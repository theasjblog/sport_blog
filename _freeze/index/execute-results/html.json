As we all do, by day I navigate the corporate world in a 9-to-5 office job, but my heart truly comes alive when I'm training for my next race.\n\n**What You'll Find Here**\n\nHere, I share my experiences of balancing a full-time career with the demanding world of triathlon training. From early morning swims to lunch-break runs and weekend cycling adventures, I'll take you through the ups and downs of pursuing athletic goals while maintaining a professional career and personal life. I will include race reports, lessons learnt from the trenches, stories about balancing family time, work responsibilities, and training, and challenges and victories of amateur triathlon.\n\n**Join Me!**\n\nWhether you're a fellow age-group triathlete, someone curious about the sport, or just interested in how to balance multiple passions with daily life, I hope you'll find value in my experiences and insights. Follow along as I share my journey of swimming, biking, and running through life!\n\n\n---\n\n# Race reports\n\n[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2023-07-09_BRACEBRIDGE_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/img/19.jpg){width=\"500\"}](posts/race_reports.qmd)\n\n# Miscellaneous\n\n[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-02-15_season_kit/img/cover.png){width=\"500\"}](posts/others.qmd)\n",
