This was organized by my high-school, and each class was competing against the each other. It was a complete obliteration of the competition. there were not really many other guys used to play at the level I was playing at the time, and even then I could count on another super strong girl in my class. At the end, we just destroyed everyone. It almost wasn't even fun at then end. Almost...\n\nI particularly remember two matches.\n\nIn one, we came close to a brawl. I stole the ball and sprinted away for a solo counterattack, when somebody from the other team decided to just push me on the floor. Memories flushed before my eyes, as that is exactly how I broke one elbow a few years prior. This time, there was no injury, but I sprang up looking for the guy. Luckily he was quick to apologize and it ended there. And I say luckily for myself as well, as he was a bit bigger than me, and I have no experience at all being in a fight, so I don't think getting into one would have been a great idea anyway.\n\nThe other match I remember well was a strange one. It was against the class of a guy I was playing against in the provincial teams tournament, and his specialty was 3 points shoots. I have never been a good long range shooter. I have always got out of trouble getting into the paint. The match started with him ding what he was good at, scoring every single long distance shot he was taking. And here is the strange thing. A couple of times I was completely open on the 3 points line, and I took the shot. And I made it. That must have gave me confidence or something, and I started to shoot more and more, and scoring more and more. It ended up almost looking like a 2024 NBA match: a 3 points contest, rather than a basketball game. But that time it worked for us, as we won the match.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Summary\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"row g-4\">\n\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n    <div class=\"card h-100 bg-info text-white\">\n      <div class=\"card-body\">\n        <h5 class=\"card-title\"><b>Position overall: 1</b></h5>\n        <p class=\"card-text\"></p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n<!--\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n    <div class=\"card h-100 bg-primary text-white\">\n      <div class=\"card-body\">\n        <h5 class=\"card-title\"><b>Position gender: 2</b></h5>\n        <p class=\"card-text\"></p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n    <div class=\"card h-100 bg-success text-white\">\n      <div class=\"card-body\">\n        <h5 class=\"card-title\"><b>Position category: 2</b></h5>\n        <p class=\"card-text\"></p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n-->\n</div>\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {layout-ncol=4}\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport/1999_TORNEO_BASKET_BOSCARDIN/img/01.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport/1999_TORNEO_BASKET_BOSCARDIN/img/02.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n\n:::\n",
