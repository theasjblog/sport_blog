I talked about the format in general in [this page](../2025-02-22_INDOOR_TRIATHLON_SERIES_RACE_1/index.qmd).\n\nIn summary, in this series you get points for how far you swim, bike, and run in 15 minutes. The further you go, the more points you get. The series is made by 4 races, but only the top 3 results for each competitors count towards the final total. Whoever gets more point at then end of the series wins the championship and get the trophy. Age Grouper can still hope to win bragging rights if they pace at the top of their 10years group, but they only get a digital certificate.\n\n\nGoing into this event I had 2 objective:\n\n* Maintain the age group leadership.\n* Do better (or at least not worse) that the previous event.\n\nI had no aspiration for the overall title because there is no way at at 40+ years of age I can compete with 20years old in this type of events.\n\nSo, how did it go?\n\n## Races comparison\n\n\n|            | Swim laps | Bike distance | Run laps |\n|------------|-----------|---------------|----------|\n| **Race 1** | 16.5      | 9             | 15       |\n| **Race 3** | 15.5      | 10.6          | 16.5     |\n\nThe swim was disappointing. I felt like I was doing a good job. I swam the first few minutes trailing behind the other guy in my lane -which I think is the guy who finished second in the age group-, but then I passed him and kept the lead. Sure I was probably too conservative with my energy management, but I did not think I was being so conservative.\n\nOn the bike I felt good. Again I tried to not get too tired out, and this time I actually bike for the whole 15min, I did not start late. I do not recall exactly for how long I cycled in the first race, but let's say about 13min. That would be 9/13=0.69km/min. This time I did 10.6Km and I stopped at around 14:45, since I knew I could not do 400 more meters in 15seconds and get more points. That would be 10.6/14.75=0.72km/min. So a bit faster, maybe around 1Km/h faster.\n\nThe run was my highlight of the day. I started easy. 3 guys went off immediately, but they stayed about 20m ahead. I slowly caught them all. In the final minutes two of the three -two guys in their early twenties-, picked up the pace again and I just could not stay with them, but I did stay ahead of my rival for the Age Group first place. In the end I covered 300m more than in the previous race, which does not sound like much, but that is the difference between 5min/km and 4:30min/km. So still not where I want to be, but getting there.\n\n## Ranking\n\n### Race ranking\n\nIn this race I finished 7$^{th}$ overall and 2$^{nd}$ in the Age Group. The guy that finished first was incredible: 21 swim laps (1050), 10.5Km on the bike, and 18.5 run laps (3.7Km). Just no way I can keep up with him, especially in the water.\n\n![Age group ranking for Race 3](./img/02.png)\n\n### Series ranking\n\nThe good news for me is that Paul did not do race 1, so he has no way to catch me in the series ranking, unless he will take part in race 4 and for reason I will not be able to. With that said, here is the ranking (male only).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Name               | Points|Age    | n_races|\n|:------------------|------:|:------|-------:|\n|Paul Shortis       |   2798|M19<   |       2|\n|Adrian Joseph      |   2403|M40-49 |       2|\n|Nick Kovacs        |   2350|M40-49 |       2|\n|Lucien Peron       |   2333|M50+   |       2|\n|Keith Brown        |   2238|M50+   |       2|\n|Paul Duhamel       |   2133|M50+   |       2|\n|Steve Young        |   2070|M40-49 |       2|\n|Robert Campbell    |   2060|M50+   |       2|\n|Christopher Laszlo |   2051|M40-49 |       2|\n|Julian Kenney      |   1685|M50+   |       2|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis table now tells a few things:\n\n* If Paul Shortins does not show up at the next race, I have a shot at the championship. Unlikely, but possible. Otherwise, no way I can close that gap of 395 points.\n* For the Age Group championship, it is tight. I have a 53 points lead, and it does not take much to rack up more than 53 points: Swim 25m more, bike 500m more, run and 200m more, and you have collected 60 extra points. What gives me hope is that until now I always managed to outperform Nick in every sport -well, except the bike on the first race, but there he only covered 500m more, and I cycled for 2min less-. But you've never won until you crossed the finish line first!\n\n\n## Waiting for race 4\n\nRace 4 is coming soon: May 4$^{th}$. It is going to be an interesting one. All out to protect the Age group lead!\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-3bc2c2b1a8b7085cfd1c\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-3bc2c2b1a8b7085cfd1c\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"vertical\":false,\"data\":[[\"race\",\"type\",\"distance\",\"position_overall\",\"position_category\",\"time\",\"date\",\"swim\",\"t1\",\"bike\",\"t2\",\"run\",\"details_1\"],[\"INDOOR TRIATHLON PROVINCIAL CHAMPIONSHIP - RACE 3\",\"indoor triathlon\",\"15min/15min/15min\",\"7/94\",\"2/8\",\"0:45:00\",\"2025-04-12\",\"775m\",\"10:00\",\"10.6Km\",\"10:00\",\"3.3Km\",\"<a href=\\\"https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/18810070492\\\">Link to activity file<\\/a>\"]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th><\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"paging\":true,\"pageLength\":20,\"columnDefs\":[{\"name\":null,\"targets\":0},{\"name\":null,\"targets\":1}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false,\"lengthMenu\":[10,20,25,50,100]}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {layout-ncol=4}\n![](img_modal/00.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](img_modal/01.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](img_modal/02.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n:::\n\n",
