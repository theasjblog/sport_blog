You could participate in many different events: 100m, 110m hurdles, 4X100m relay, high jump, long jump, put throw, etc. \n\nThe first round was within the school. The winners in each event qualified for the next round and competed against kids from other schools. I remember I qualified one year, but I do not remember if it was this one.\n\nAt the time my main sport was basketball, and in this competition I was going for the 100m and the high jump, maybe once I did the 110m hurdles. I do not know exactly what I did in this event. Apparently my records says that I did the 100m in this event, and I finished 2$^{nd}$, but I cannot guarantee that's accurate. Also I am not 100% sure this happened in 1998.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Summary\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"row g-4\">\n\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n    <div class=\"card h-100 bg-info text-white\">\n      <div class=\"card-body\">\n        <h5 class=\"card-title\"><b>Position overall: 2</b></h5>\n        <p class=\"card-text\"></p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n    <div class=\"card h-100 bg-primary text-white\">\n      <div class=\"card-body\">\n        <h5 class=\"card-title\"><b>Position gender: 2</b></h5>\n        <p class=\"card-text\"></p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n    <div class=\"card h-100 bg-success text-white\">\n      <div class=\"card-body\">\n        <h5 class=\"card-title\"><b>Position category: 2</b></h5>\n        <p class=\"card-text\"></p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n</div>\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {layout-ncol=4}\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport/1998_GIOCHI_DELLA_GIOVENT%C3%99/img/01.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n\n:::\n",
