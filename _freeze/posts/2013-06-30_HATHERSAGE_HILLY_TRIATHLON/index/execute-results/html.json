Organized by the Sheffield Triathlon Club in Hathersage, in the middle of the Peak District. A great place. I do not remember the distances exactly, but they were a bit odd, somewhere in between a sprint and a standard, except for the swim that was a short one in a heated outdoor pool. The main \"selling\" point was that, has the name implies and because of the venue (the Peak District), it was \"hilly\". Very hilly...\n\nI went to this race with my girlfriend. I rented a car that was too small for the job, but somehow I managed to fit the bike in the boot. We got there very early, even before most of the marshals. It was nice to see the calm water of the pool before anyone had the chance to jump in or to set up the lanes.\n\nI set up the bike in T1 and the run kit in T2 (they had different transition zones), double and triple checking I had everything I needed laid out. I then went to the race briefing listening to every world, even if it was the usual obvious stuff (shared roads, dismount line, rack the bike before you take the helmet off, etc.).\n\nWhen the race started I was quite nervous, not knowing if I had it in me to finish a triathlon race. At the time I did not have a multi-sport watch. I was planning to swim with the Garmin Swim, and then change over to another watch. Except in the excitement of the first race I messed up everything. To this day I am not sure with what piece of tech I finished the race...\n\nAnyway, the swim went as good as it could have: I did not drawn and I finished it. The bike was OK. A challenging route, with plenty of hills and wind, but fun. The real problems started with T2. After I chenged into my running gear, I guess I started to pay my dues to the inexperience. First I could not find the exit to the run. I had to ask my girlfriend where I had to go. Finally, I was out running. But not for long. Very quickly, the run started to feel more like an orienteering race than a triathlon race. The idea was to run up and down into the woods on a hill. Except there was little to no signalling or marshaling. I got lost a couple of time and my watch told me I did almost 1Km more than I was supposed to. It was of little consolation knowing that I was not the only one. I remember seeing people that somehow ended up running on a road well out of the running route...\n\n\nAll in all, it was a good and fun race. I have never done it again because I was not a fun of the hilly run with poor marking, but if that is you jam, go for it, you won't regret doing the Hathersage Hilly Triathlon.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-4440e8c366ce9f00b702\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-4440e8c366ce9f00b702\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"vertical\":false,\"data\":[[\"race\",\"type\",\"distance\",\"time\",\"date\",\"swim\",\"t1\",\"bike\",\"t2\",\"run\"],[\"HATHERSAGE HILLY TRIATHLON\",\"sprint triathlon\",\"420m/20K/5K\",\"1h 38m 37s\",\"2013-06-30\",\"10m 15s\",\"1m 23s\",\"46m 7s\",\"57s\",\"39m 53s\"]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th><\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"paging\":true,\"pageLength\":20,\"columnDefs\":[{\"name\":null,\"targets\":0},{\"name\":null,\"targets\":1}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false,\"lengthMenu\":[10,20,25,50,100]}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {layout-ncol=4}\n![](img_modal/00a0.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](img_modal/00a1.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](img_modal/00a2.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](img_modal/00c.jpg){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](img_modal/01.jpg){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](img_modal/04.jpg){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](img_modal/06.jpg){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](img_modal/14.jpg){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](img_modal/19.jpg){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](img_modal/20.jpg){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](img_modal/21.jpg){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](img_modal/24.jpg){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](img_modal/25.jpg){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](img_modal/28.jpg){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](img_modal/29.jpg){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](img_modal/31.jpg){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n\n:::\n",
