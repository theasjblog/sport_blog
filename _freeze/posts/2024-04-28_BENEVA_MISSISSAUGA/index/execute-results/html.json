On paper, a flat and fast 10K, good as a test event. In reality, there ware a couple of \"hills\". Nothing major, but for sure  something that could affect people hunting for a PB. But that was not me. My focus was simply to see what I could. No main goal, except maybe at least stay under 45min.\n\nThis was also the first official outing of my first ever pair of racing shoes with carbon plate. Those shoes are indeed quite fast, they feel very light and springy.\n\nThe main event of the race was probably me kicking a young child, maybe 5yro. I was on my KM8, and a family (spectators) crossed the road in front of me to cheer on someone. I moved to the right a bit to avoid them, and it would have been enough if the little girl did not panic and stop right in front of me. So she got a knee on the back. She was OK, just scared.\n\nThe annoying thing on the prize giving was that they only recognized the first 3 in some category they made up, and mot the standard divisions. I finished 3rd in my division, but 4th in the category they made up...\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-cccf6233223f595c1fdf\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-cccf6233223f595c1fdf\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"vertical\":false,\"data\":[[\"race\",\"type\",\"distance\",\"position_overall\",\"position_category\",\"time\",\"date\",\"details_1\"],[\"BENEVA MISSISSAUGA\",\"run\",\"10K\",\"16/1009\",\"3/96\",\"43m 42s\",\"2024-04-28\",\"<a href=\\\"https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/15123661271\\\">Link to activity file<\\/a>\"]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th><\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"paging\":true,\"pageLength\":20,\"columnDefs\":[{\"name\":null,\"targets\":0},{\"name\":null,\"targets\":1}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false,\"lengthMenu\":[10,20,25,50,100]}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {layout-ncol=4}\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2024-04-28_BENEVA_MISSISSAUGA/img/00.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2024-04-28_BENEVA_MISSISSAUGA/img/01.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2024-04-28_BENEVA_MISSISSAUGA/img/02.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2024-04-28_BENEVA_MISSISSAUGA/img/06.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n\n:::\n",
