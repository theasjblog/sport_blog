It did not happen. Also, slightly annoying finishing 6th, when the first 5 were called up to the podium...\n\nAnyway, I managed the swim fairly well. A bit slower maybe than I would have liked, but the mass start did no help. I was not used to that anymore.\n\nAfter the swim we had a long hike to transition. A small fight with the wetsuit, and I was off on the bike.\n\nMounting was smoother than the previous race (Milton): using the  elastic to keep the shoes in place was a good idea.\n\nThe bike was uneventful, just a lot of inexperienced riders on the road to overtake. Maybe a bit too hilly for my likening. Not big hills, just. a lot of up and downs.\nThe main issue I had on the bike was that about 1KM in I realized I had lost my water bottle straw because of the bumpy road surface. So I just got thirsty from there on.\n\nOn the last kilometer or so of the bike I caught up with the guy in front on on my age group. I opted to pass him, spending a few extra energy.\n\nI did not stay ahead for long. He was a much stronger runner. He finished the run in something around 19min.\n\nOverall the race was not bad. I set a new PB for the distance, improving the old one by around 2min, and I finished less than 4min behind the age category winner, so much closer than in the past.\n\nAs a qualifying event, I would have liked to finish higher up, but I cannot control who show up to a race. I just need to focus on how I executed the race plan.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-a59aaa188e8890ffe38e\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-a59aaa188e8890ffe38e\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"vertical\":false,\"data\":[[\"race\",\"type\",\"distance\",\"position_overall\",\"position_category\",\"time\",\"date\",\"swim\",\"t1\",\"bike\",\"t2\",\"run\",\"details_1\"],[\"GUELPH LAKE 1 SUBARU TRIATHLON\",\"sprint triathlon\",\"750m/20K/5K\",\"24/364\",\"6/33\",\"1h 13m 7s\",\"2024-06-16\",\"13m 57s\",\"2m 58s\",\"34m 4s\",\"39s\",\"21m 30s\",\"<a href=\\\"https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/15941375520\\\">Link to activity file<\\/a>\"]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th><\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"paging\":true,\"pageLength\":20,\"columnDefs\":[{\"name\":null,\"targets\":0},{\"name\":null,\"targets\":1}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false,\"lengthMenu\":[10,20,25,50,100]}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {layout-ncol=4}\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2024-06-16_GUELPH_LAKE_1_SUBARU_TRIATHLON/img/00.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2024-06-16_GUELPH_LAKE_1_SUBARU_TRIATHLON/img/01.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2024-06-16_GUELPH_LAKE_1_SUBARU_TRIATHLON/img/01a.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2024-06-16_GUELPH_LAKE_1_SUBARU_TRIATHLON/img/01b.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2024-06-16_GUELPH_LAKE_1_SUBARU_TRIATHLON/img/01c.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2024-06-16_GUELPH_LAKE_1_SUBARU_TRIATHLON/img/03.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2024-06-16_GUELPH_LAKE_1_SUBARU_TRIATHLON/img/10.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2024-06-16_GUELPH_LAKE_1_SUBARU_TRIATHLON/img/14.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2024-06-16_GUELPH_LAKE_1_SUBARU_TRIATHLON/img/22.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2024-06-16_GUELPH_LAKE_1_SUBARU_TRIATHLON/img/24.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2024-06-16_GUELPH_LAKE_1_SUBARU_TRIATHLON/img/28.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n\n:::\n",
