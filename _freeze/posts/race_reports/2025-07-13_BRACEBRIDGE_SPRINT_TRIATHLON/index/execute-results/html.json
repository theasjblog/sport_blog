This time it’s part of my lead-up to the Age Group World Championships. While this wasn’t meant to be an “A” race, I still showed up hoping to match — or beat — my performances from the last two years.\n\n*Spoiler alert: that didn’t happen.*\n\n## The build up to the race\n\nLet’s rewind a bit. Two weeks out from the race, things started going sideways. Sleep? Barely. I was averaging 5–6 hours a night, never more than two hours in a row. Basically, I was sleepwalking to the start line.\n\nThen the shoulder saga began. I did a 2,600m open water swim in Kennisis Lake and — boom — right shoulder pain. Bad enough that I had to stay out of the water for a week. And when I did get back in, every single open water swim was painfully slower — like 15–20 seconds per 100m slower than my pool pace. Sure, pools are faster (thanks, flip turns), but that kind of drop? Come on.\n\nAs if that wasn’t enough, my wetsuit felt like it was trying to suffocate me. I might’ve gained a bit of muscle lately (thanks, strength training!), and the suit just wasn’t having it. It even gave me a couple of cuts near the shoulders, and I could feel water rushing into the sleeves. If wetsuits ended up being optional, I was 100% ditching it.\n\nOh, and I did something really smart too — went kayaking for 30+ km over a few days at the cottage, just because I love it. My shoulder had just recovered and I figured, “Why not?” Turns out: because you have a race coming up is why not.\n\n## Race day. Let’s go.\n\n\n### Swim\n\n![Swim.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-07-13_BRACEBRIDGE_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/img/DSC00993.jpg)\n\nMy swim strategy was \"don’t blow up.\" I stayed calm, maybe too calm. In hindsight, I think I could’ve gone faster even if I went into the red. My time? Over 17 minutes for 750m — easily one of my slowest swims ever. Not exactly the tone I wanted to set.\n\n### T1\n\nT1 was smooth — until the end. I made the ultimate rookie mistake: unracked the bike before putting my helmet on. Yep. That rule you literally can’t miss because your helmet is on the handlebars? Broke it. A referee saw me, said something ending in “5-second penalty” (should’ve been 15?), but didn’t point me to a penalty box. I never saw one either. So I just... kept going. Not ideal.\n\n### Bike \n\n![Bike.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-07-13_BRACEBRIDGE_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/img/DSC02883.jpg)\n\nOnto the bike. This is usually where I claw back some ground. Not today. Everyone around me had slick TT bikes and looked strong. I had my road bike, and recently removed the aero bars, so I was still adjusting to the new position. Oh, and my Garmin decided to nap through the whole ride — wouldn’t start, wouldn’t record, wouldn’t even pretend to work. I tried to fire up a new activity mid-race but gave up. So, I rode blind.\n\nAnd just when I thought things couldn’t get worse, twice I got stuck behind confused drivers on course who slowed me down to a crawl. Final time: 39:12 for 20k — that’s just over 30.6 km/h. Ouch. More than 2 minutes slower than my first year here. No power, no data, no juice.\n\n### T2\n\nT2? Fine. I didn’t trust my flying dismount, so I played it safe and stepped off. No drama. Still no sign of a penalty marker, so I just kept going.\n\n### Run\n\n![Run.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-07-13_BRACEBRIDGE_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/img/DSC04228.jpg)\n\nThe run. Oh boy. Let’s call it what it was: a *shuffle*. One of my slowest 5ks ever at 24:12 — 2 minutes off last year’s pace. It was 30°C by then, which didn’t help, but honestly? I just didn’t have the legs or the fire. My body was like, “Hard pass.”\n\n## Recap\n\nFinal time: 1:22:19. Somehow, that was good enough for 3rd in my age group, which probably says more about the field than my performance. I stuck around for the award ceremony, constantly glancing over my shoulder wondering if I was going to get hit with a disqualification for that helmet snafu.\n\nAll in all? Pretty rough day out. But also a much-needed wake-up call. Here’s what I’m taking away from this:\n\n* **Dial back the fatigue**. I think I was carrying too much neuromuscular load and wasn’t prepped for race-level intensity.\n* **More 5K practice**. I’ll hit up a few Parkruns to find my legs again.\n* **Recheck my zones**. I suspect my Humango high-intensity sessions aren’t quite hitting the right level — or lasting long enough.\n* **New wetsuit**. The current one’s officially fired.\n* **Push harder in the water**. I need to get used to real effort in open water without falling apart.\n* **More race-specific bricks**. Because nothing prepares you for race day like simulating race day.\n* **Prioritize recovery**. Like actually. Not just foam rolling and pretending that’s enough.\n\nNext up: Wasaga Beach in a bit over a month. With any luck — and a little smarter prep — I’ll be back on track.\n\nStay tuned, and if you've ever unracked your bike before putting your helmet on... well, at least I’m not alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-4f6a34c66e53441a7a2b\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-4f6a34c66e53441a7a2b\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"top\",\"vertical\":false,\"filterHTML\":\"<tr>\\n  <td data-type=\\\"character\\\" style=\\\"vertical-align: top;\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"form-group has-feedback\\\" style=\\\"margin-bottom: auto;\\\">\\n      <input type=\\\"search\\\" placeholder=\\\"All\\\" class=\\\"form-control\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%;\\\"/>\\n      <span class=\\\"glyphicon glyphicon-remove-circle form-control-feedback\\\"><\\/span>\\n    <\\/div>\\n  <\\/td>\\n  <td data-type=\\\"character\\\" style=\\\"vertical-align: top;\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"form-group has-feedback\\\" style=\\\"margin-bottom: auto;\\\">\\n      <input type=\\\"search\\\" placeholder=\\\"All\\\" class=\\\"form-control\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%;\\\"/>\\n      <span class=\\\"glyphicon glyphicon-remove-circle form-control-feedback\\\"><\\/span>\\n    <\\/div>\\n  <\\/td>\\n<\\/tr>\",\"data\":[[\"Final time\",\"Sport 1 time\",\"Sport 2 time\",\"Sport 3 Time\",\"Overall ranking\",\"Gender ranking\",\"Category ranking\",\"Activity details\"],[\"01:22:19\",\"00:17:12\",\"00:39:12\",\"00:24:12\",\"21\",\"20\",\"3\",\"<a href=\\\"https://asjblog.shinyapps.io/single_race_viewer/?_inputs_&selector=%222025-07-13_XTJAP%22\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Link<\\/a><\\/a>\"]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th>2025-07-13<\\/th>\\n      <th>SPRINT TRIATHLON 750M/20K/5K<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"paging\":true,\"pageLength\":10,\"columnDefs\":[{\"name\":\"2025-07-13\",\"targets\":0},{\"name\":\"SPRINT TRIATHLON 750M/20K/5K\",\"targets\":1}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false,\"orderCellsTop\":true}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {layout-ncol=4}\n![Third place medal.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-07-13_BRACEBRIDGE_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/img/IMG_2064.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![Finisher medal.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-07-13_BRACEBRIDGE_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/img/IMG_2065.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![Medal ribbons.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-07-13_BRACEBRIDGE_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/img/IMG_2068.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![Race bib.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-07-13_BRACEBRIDGE_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/img/IMG_2069.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![Swim cap.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-07-13_BRACEBRIDGE_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/img/IMG_2066.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![Swim cap.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-07-13_BRACEBRIDGE_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/img/IMG_2067.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![Ready to start the swim.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-07-13_BRACEBRIDGE_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/img/DSC07947.jpg){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![Swim.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-07-13_BRACEBRIDGE_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/img/DSC00993.jpg){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![Bike.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-07-13_BRACEBRIDGE_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/img/DSC02883.jpg){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![Run.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-07-13_BRACEBRIDGE_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/img/DSC04228.jpg){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![Finish line.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-07-13_BRACEBRIDGE_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/img/DSC09152.jpg){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![M40-45 podium.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-07-13_BRACEBRIDGE_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/img/DSC08931.jpg){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n:::\n",
