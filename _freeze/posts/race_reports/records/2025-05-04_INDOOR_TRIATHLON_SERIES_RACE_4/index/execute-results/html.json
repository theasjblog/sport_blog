If you're not familiar with the format, I talked about it more in [this post](../2025-02-22_INDOOR_TRIATHLON_SERIES_RACE_1/index.qmd) and [this one](../2025-04-12_INDOOR_TRIATHLON_SERIES_RACE_3/index.qmd).\n\n## Quick Recap of the Format\n\nIn this series, your score is based on how far you can swim, bike, and run in 15 minutes each. The further you go, the more points you earn. The series includes four races, but only your best three results count toward the final standings. Whoever has the highest point total at the end wins the championship (and gets a pretty cool trophy). Age Group athletes can also earn bragging rights—and a digital certificate—if they top their 10-year age group.\n\n## My Goals Going In\n\nHeading into this event, I had two main goals:\n\n* Hold on to my age group lead.\n* Do better (or at least not worse) than the previous race.\n\nI wasn’t aiming for the overall title—let’s be real, at 40+ years old, it’s tough to compete with 20-somethings in a sprint-style event like this.\n\n## Age group ranking\n\nDid I manage to keep my age group lead? Yep—and it didn’t take much effort. I was the only one in my age group!\n\nSo yes, the competitive spirit wasn’t exactly raging in M40–49, but it did guarantee me the win in the Age Group category for the series. Here’s how the final series rankings looked:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Name             |Age Group | Age Group Ranking| Overall Ranking|\n|:----------------|:---------|-----------------:|---------------:|\n|Paul Shortis     |M19<      |                 1|               1|\n|Adrian Joseph    |M40-49    |                 1|               2|\n|Lucien Peron     |M50+      |                 1|               3|\n|Brian Seed       |M30-39    |                 1|               5|\n|Tenzin Augarshar |M20-29    |                 1|               9|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nSince this is a series, the people who race at least three times are more likely to win overall—it’s a numbers game. In my case, I was the only M40–49 athlete to race in three or more events. That said, I like to compare my placement across each race to see how close I am to the top of my age grooup.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Name          | Race [#]| Swim Ranking| Bike Ranking| Run Ranking| Final Ranking|\n|:-------------|--------:|------------:|------------:|-----------:|-------------:|\n|Adrian Joseph |        1|            1|            3|           3|             1|\n|Adrian Joseph |        3|            3|            1|           2|             2|\n|Adrian Joseph |        4|            1|            1|           1|             1|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAs expected, my bike suffers on the first race because I started a couple of minutes late, and my swim on Race 3 was not great. Regardless, I was always up there, so at least I can tell myself that I did not win the Series only because I was the only one doing three races. I was always up there.\n\n\n## Races comparison\n\n### Swim\n\nLet’s start with the swim. One change in Race 4: it was held in a 25-meter pool instead of a 50-meter one, which usually leads to faster times.\n\nHere are the summary metrics:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Race [#] | Distance [m]| Time [sec/50m]| Time Variation [%]| Strokes Rate [spm]| Strokes Rate Variation [%]|\n|:--------|------------:|--------------:|------------------:|------------------:|--------------------------:|\n|Race 1   |          850|             54|               7.31|                 65|                      -2.74|\n|Race 3   |          800|             54|              13.05|                 65|                     -11.71|\n|Race 4   |          875|             50|               0.67|                 66|                      -1.23|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThere wasn't a huge difference in total distance, but Race 4 was the fastest—and, more importantly, the most consistent. I calculated the percentage change between the first and second halves of the swim. Ideally, I want an even or negative split.\n\n* Race 1: 7% slower in the second half.\n* Race 3: 13% slower (!) in the ssecond half.\n* Race 4: Less than 1% slower in the second half.\n\nStroke rate followed the same trend. All in all, Race 4 was way more even. I also focused on minimizing leg movement—something I’ll definitely keep working on.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nRace 4 started off faster, but then I was able to hold the pace better than in the other races. I remember thinking a lot about trying to limit legs movement. I think that is something I should continue working on.\n\n### Bike\n\nNot much to report here. I didn’t have sensors connected to my watch, so all I have are the official distances:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Race [#] | Distane [km]|\n|:--------|------------:|\n|Race 1   |          9.0|\n|Race 2   |         10.6|\n|Race 4   |         10.6|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nRace 1 was a bit of a mess—I didn’t realize the race had started and lost a couple of minutes. The good news: the bike effort felt easier each time.\n\n### Run\n\nNow for the run. Here's the data:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| Distance [km]|Pace [min/km] | Pace Variation [%]| Power [W]| Power Variation [%]| Cadence [spm]| Cadence Variation [%]| Ground Time [ms]| Ground Time Variation [%]| Heart Rate [bpm]|\n|-------------:|:-------------|------------------:|---------:|-------------------:|-------------:|---------------------:|----------------:|-------------------------:|----------------:|\n|          3.11|4:47          |               6.80|       306|               -6.41|            82|                 -0.65|            250.9|                      5.24|              149|\n|          3.53|4:14          |              -1.51|       334|                3.06|            88|                 -2.38|            231.3|                      0.60|              162|\n|          3.59|4:10          |              -0.60|       339|                1.72|            89|                 -2.22|            225.8|                      3.47|              162|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nI’m pretty happy with the progression. While I’m still not quite at the speed I’d like, things are trending in the right direction. Power is up, cadence is up, and I managed to keep an even or negative split.\n\nRace 1 was a bit of a head-scratcher—I couldn’t raise my heart rate or generate much speed. I suspect I went too hard on the bike trying to make up for the late start.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Official results\n\nThe distances above are from my Garmin and Stryd power meter, which are great for comparisons—but not always accurate compared to the official results. For example, running in the outside lane to pass others adds distance that isn’t captured in the official numbers.\n\nHere’s the official breakdown:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Race [#] | Swim [m]| Swim Points| Bike [km]| Bike Points| Run [km]| Run Points| Total Points|\n|:--------|--------:|-----------:|---------:|-----------:|--------:|----------:|------------:|\n|Race 1   |      825|         330|       9.0|         450|      3.0|        375|         1150|\n|Race 2   |      775|         310|      10.6|         530|      3.3|        413|         1253|\n|Race 4   |      887|         355|      10.6|         530|      3.4|        425|         1310|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAll in all, I’m happy with how things went. There’s clear improvement across the board, and more importantly, I felt stronger each time out. That’s a good sign as I head into the outdoor season. Let’s see what the next phase brings!\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {layout-ncol=4}\n\n:::\n\n",
