The travel, the walking around Wollongong, and all the pre-race logistics had taken their toll. Still, the adrenaline of being here overpowered everything else.\n\n---\n\n## üéí The Days Before\n\nI collected my race pack the very first day: arm and calf stickers, swim cap, bike and helmet numbers, a transition bag, a nice backpack, a beach towel, and a *Welcome to Wollongong* booklet.  \nThe next day, I dropped off my bike for the mandatory pre-race check ‚Äî with **1,260 athletes** in the sprint alone, this keeps things organized.\n\nOn the way there, I got my first omen: the bike squeaked and cracked with every pedal stroke. Not ideal.\n\n![In this races you have to rack the bike the day befre the race. So many bikes!](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-10-17_SPRINT_TRIATHLON_WOLLONGONG/img/IMG_2261.png){width=\"500\"}\n\n---\n\n## ‚òÄÔ∏è Race Morning\n\nFor once, I didn‚Äôt have to wake up at 4 a.m. My start was at **10:45**, pure luxury.  \nI had a calm breakfast, applied my number stickers, and walked to transition.\n\nThere, surrounded by incredibly fit athletes from all over the world, it was easy to feel out of place. I reminded myself to stick to my plan and not get distracted.  \nMy setup was dialed in: bike shoes clipped and held by elastics, helmet with sunglasses on the bars, running shoes with a gel tucked inside, race belt ready, and Vaseline around the shoe entry for a fast slip-in.\n\nAfter some dynamic stretching and elastic-band warm-up, I dropped my bag and headed toward the swim start.\n\n---\n\n## üèä Swim ‚Äî Chaos in the Harbour\n\nA surprise awaited us: due to high waves, the course was moved **inside the harbour**. For a weaker swimmer like me, that was a relief.\n\nI warmed up briefly in the water, then lined up with my wave ‚Äî **76 athletes**, shoulder to shoulder.  \nThe speaker‚Äôs words echoed: *‚ÄúAthletes, you are now in the hands of the starter.‚Äù*  \nHeartbeats. Silence. The horn blasted.\n\nChaos. Bodies everywhere. Some swimmers veered off course, making it hard to stay straight.  \nI kept calm, knowing that going too hard early would only lead to fading later.\n\nI exited the water **56th of 76** ‚Äî far from the front, but I wasn‚Äôt last, and more importantly, I made the cutoff I had been worried about.\n\n![Swim done!](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-10-17_SPRINT_TRIATHLON_WOLLONGONG/img/153_3rd-3388546-DIGITAL_HIGHRES-9989_11448-77713437.JPG){width=\"500\"}\n\n---\n\n## üö¥ Bike ‚Äî Two Loops of Noise\n\nTransition was long ‚Äî nearly **400 m** from swim exit to bike mount ‚Äî but it went smoothly for once.\n\nThe bike course had two loops: a technical first half with small hills, then a flat, fast stretch back. Perfect variety.\n\nI tried to stay with a group early on, but when they pushed the pace, I let them go.  \nI didn‚Äôt want to repeat past mistakes of blowing up before the run.  \nI settled around **249 W**, slightly below my **255 W goal**, but steady.\n\nThe only problem: my bike sounded like it was falling apart ‚Äî constant squeaks and cracks.  \nI prayed it would hold together to the end.\n\n\n![Bike leg.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-10-17_SPRINT_TRIATHLON_WOLLONGONG/img/176_3rd-3388546-DIGITAL_HIGHRES-9989_25888-77713460.JPG){width=\"500\"}\n\n---\n\n## üèÉ Run ‚Äî Holding It Together\n\nT2 was quick, no drama.\n\nMy legs felt heavier than I hoped, but I focused on rhythm.  \nThe run course had rolling hills and heat, and I maintained a **4:30 min/km** pace ‚Äî not spectacular, but consistent.  \nI even managed to pick it up in the last 500 m.\n\nThen came the **blue carpet** ‚Äî that magical final stretch.  \nCrossing the finish arch with a World Championship medal around my neck was a moment I‚Äôll never forget.\n\n![Down Flagstaff Hill.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-10-17_SPRINT_TRIATHLON_WOLLONGONG/img/193_3rd-3388546-DIGITAL_HIGHRES-9989_34874-77713477.JPG){width=\"500\"}\n\n---\n\n## üì∏ Gallery\n\n::: {.gallery cols=3}\n![Bike checked in and ready to race.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-10-17_SPRINT_TRIATHLON_WOLLONGONG/img/IMG_2262.png){width=\"100\"}\n\n![Swim done!](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-10-17_SPRINT_TRIATHLON_WOLLONGONG/img/147_3rd-3388546-DIGITAL_HIGHRES-9989_3713-77713431.JPG){width=\"100\"}\n\n![Getting ready for T2.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-10-17_SPRINT_TRIATHLON_WOLLONGONG/img/177_3rd-3388546-DIGITAL_HIGHRES-9989_26291-77713461.JPG){width=\"100\"}\n\n![Crossig the finish line.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-10-17_SPRINT_TRIATHLON_WOLLONGONG/img/207_3rd-3388546-DIGITAL_HIGHRES-9989_54110-77713491.JPG){width=\"100\"}\n\n![The medal, front and back.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-10-15_WOLLONGONG/img/IMG_2310.png){width=\"100\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n## üá®üá¶ Little Rivalries\n\nI had two ‚Äúrivals‚Äù in mind:  \n- A Canadian I met at swim familiarization ‚Äî confident and strong in the water. I ended up beating him.  \n- Another Canadian from the bike group that had dropped me. I reeled him in on the run and passed him in the final lap, finishing about **10 seconds ahead**.\n\nTwo small, personal wins that made the day even sweeter.\n\n---\n\n## üèÅ Results and Reflections\n\nI finished **56th of 77**. Not spectacular on paper, but in context ‚Äî this was the **world‚Äôs best amateur field**, every athlete here having earned their spot.\n\nMy time of **1:15:35** was solid, even a bit faster than my season average given the heat and course difficulty.  \nI also finished **2nd of 6 Canadians** ‚Äî a proud result.\n\nLooking back at my goals:\n\n- **Top 10%** ‚Üí not met, but a poor metric anyway since it depends on who shows up.  \n- **Time goal (1:10‚Äì1:20)** ‚Üí met halfway at 1:15:35.  \n- **Don‚Äôt fade on the run** ‚Üí ‚úÖ  \n- **Not last** ‚Üí ‚úÖ  \n- **Top 3 Canadians** ‚Üí ‚úÖ  \n\nMost importantly, I executed my plan.  \nI raced smart, steady, and left the finish line with a smile instead of a grimace.  \nThat, to me, is a success.\n\n\n---\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n[‚¨ÖÔ∏è Previous post: The Road to Wollongong](../../others/2025-10-15_WOLLONGONG_OVERALL/index.qmd)\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-efd9c4ef564b71aa788a\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-efd9c4ef564b71aa788a\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"top\",\"vertical\":false,\"filterHTML\":\"<tr>\\n  <td data-type=\\\"character\\\" style=\\\"vertical-align: top;\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"form-group has-feedback\\\" style=\\\"margin-bottom: auto;\\\">\\n      <input type=\\\"search\\\" placeholder=\\\"All\\\" class=\\\"form-control\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%;\\\"/>\\n      <span class=\\\"glyphicon glyphicon-remove-circle form-control-feedback\\\"><\\/span>\\n    <\\/div>\\n  <\\/td>\\n  <td data-type=\\\"character\\\" style=\\\"vertical-align: top;\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"form-group has-feedback\\\" style=\\\"margin-bottom: auto;\\\">\\n      <input type=\\\"search\\\" placeholder=\\\"All\\\" class=\\\"form-control\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%;\\\"/>\\n      <span class=\\\"glyphicon glyphicon-remove-circle form-control-feedback\\\"><\\/span>\\n    <\\/div>\\n  <\\/td>\\n<\\/tr>\",\"data\":[[\"Final time\",\"Sport 1 time\",\"T 1 time\",\"Sport 2 time\",\"T 2 time\",\"Sport 3 Time\",\"Overall ranking\",\"Gender ranking\",\"Category ranking\",\"Activity details\"],[\"01:15:35\",\"00:13:50\",\"00:02:23\",\"00:34:17\",\"00:02:09\",\"00:22:53\",\"535\",\"383\",\"57\",\"<a href=\\\"https://asjblog.shinyapps.io/single_race_viewer/?_inputs_&selector=%222025-10-17_FAXSR%22\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Link<\\/a><\\/a>\"]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th>2025-10-17<\\/th>\\n      <th>SPRINT TRIATHLON 750M/20K/5K<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"paging\":true,\"pageLength\":10,\"columnDefs\":[{\"name\":\"2025-10-17\",\"targets\":0},{\"name\":\"SPRINT TRIATHLON 750M/20K/5K\",\"targets\":1}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false,\"orderCellsTop\":true}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::",
