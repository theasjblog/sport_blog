Ali and I rented a car and drove up to Edinburgh. We stayed in a small B&B near the city center.\n\nOn race day, it rained in the morning, but not much and it stopped shortly after we started. The race started in city center, and my designated changing space was in a school. I did not drop y bag to the organizers, but I gave to Ali instead. In hindsight, I should have dropped it to the organizers.\n\nI started off reasonably well, and I stayed strong up until ~30K. But then I had to stop for a wee. And after I stopped, my legs refused to start again. I had to walk for 5K or so. Closer to the end, I managed to get the legs moving again, and at least I finished the day running.\n\nThe end of the race was in field in the middle of nowhere. Ali was not there, as she was waiting for me in city center, so I did not have my bag. I remember sitting down on the grass for a while, then starting the long walk to the bus shuttle.\n\nThe day after my legs were quite stiff. Ali had to do the drive back home.\n\nA tough day, but it was fun. I'm just not sure I want to do another one, and that long stuff is for me. Single sport events in articular, like this one, are boring to prepare, and for months before this race I only did runs, with little to no swimming or cycling.\n\nAlso, I had to do such a high volume at low intensity, that for years I felt like the marathon training killed my race speed.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-769e703534184a6660d4\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-769e703534184a6660d4\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"vertical\":false,\"data\":[[\"race\",\"type\",\"distance\",\"position_overall\",\"position_category\",\"time\",\"date\",\"details_1\"],[\"EDINBURGH MARATHON\",\"run\",\"42.2K\",\"3416\",\"458\",\"4h 16m 15s\",\"2019-05-26\",\"<a href=\\\"https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/3685888946\\\">Link to activity file<\\/a>\"]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th><\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"paging\":true,\"pageLength\":20,\"columnDefs\":[{\"name\":null,\"targets\":0},{\"name\":null,\"targets\":1}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false,\"lengthMenu\":[10,20,25,50,100]}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {layout-ncol=4}\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2019-05-26_EDINBURGH_MARATHON/img/00.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2019-05-26_EDINBURGH_MARATHON/img/01.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2019-05-26_EDINBURGH_MARATHON/img/02.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2019-05-26_EDINBURGH_MARATHON/img/03.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2019-05-26_EDINBURGH_MARATHON/img/04.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n\n:::\n",
