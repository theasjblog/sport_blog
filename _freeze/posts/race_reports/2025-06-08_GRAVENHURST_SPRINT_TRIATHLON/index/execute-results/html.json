While it was technically a \"C\" race (meaning lower priority), let's be honest - what athlete doesn't want to perform their best, regardless of the race's status? Even though my AI coach Hugo from HumanGo had me deep in base training (far from peak season, with my A-race coming in October), I was excited to test my fitness.\n\nTalk about challenging conditions! The universe seemed determined to make this interesting: I caught a bug on Wednesday that knocked me out of training for a couple of days, had to wake up at the ungodly hour of 3:15 AM to get there, and - just to add some spice - there were wildfires in the area making the air quality questionable. Not exactly the perfect recipe for a stellar performance!\n\nStill, I had some specific goals I was eager to tackle:\n\n1. Test my improved swimming (spoiler: well, that was humbling)\n2. Attempt flying mounts and dismounts on the bike (adventure ensued)\n3. Rock the official Team Canada racing kit (because looking fast counts, right?)\n4. Try out my shiny new Garmin Forerunner 965 (RIP trusty Fenix 5Plus)\n\n![Early morning view of the lake.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-06-08_GRAVENHURST_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/img/IMG_2017.png)\n\nLet me paint you a picture of Gravenhurst - it's this charming village in Ontario's Muskoka region, not far from Bracebridge (where I've raced twice before) and my in-laws' cottage. The swim takes place in Muskoka Lake, and despite my early-June temperature concerns, we lucked out with a comfortable 18Â°C water temperature.\n\nNow, here's where things get interesting - this race has a unique twist. Instead of your typical beach start, you get to jump off a cruise boat in the middle of the lake. Cool, right? Well, the boat had other plans, causing a 20-minute delay. At this point, I was starting to wonder if someone had broken a mirror at race headquarters.\n\n![3-2-1 JUMP!

The first 100 meters felt like a washing machine with arms and legs everywhere, but things settled down after that. I focused on maintaining good form and staying \"long\" in the water. Despite these noble intentions, my 750m time of 15:41 (2:09/100m pace) was... let's just say it wasn't setting any records. My Garmin data showed some decent patches mixed with what looked like underwater sightseeing - clearly, there's still plenty of room for improvement in my swimming!\n\nT1 featured a lengthy run-up (perfect for wetsuit stripping), but I made my first tactical error here - skipping my usual half gel and not taking any nutrition on the bike. This would come back to haunt me later.\n\nThe flying mount attempt was, well, less \"flying\" and more \"controlled stumbling.\" While I managed to start with my feet clipped in, getting them into the actual shoes was like trying to solve a Rubik's cube while riding a bike. When the elastic holding your shoes upright gives up, you're in for an interesting game of \"catch the spinning shoe\". Mental note: more practice needed!\n\n![Photo by Chappell Digital.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-06-08_GRAVENHURST_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/img/250608_Gravenhurst_1695.jpg)\n\nThe bike course, while not featuring any major climbs, threw 132m of elevation gain at us. I averaged 262W - decent but not my best. Combined with my nutrition oversight and the rising temperature (and my brilliant decision to skip hydration), I was setting myself up for an interesting run.\n\nThe flying dismount? Let's just say my brain sent a very clear \"NOPE\" signal as I approached the line. Sometimes discretion is the better part of valor, so I opted for a less dramatic stop-and-step approach.\n\nThe run started with my legs performing an impromptu cramping routine, followed by a delightful reminder of my recent illness in the form of some very attractive coughing. Between the gravel start (not my favorite), the hills, and my body's various protests, it wasn't exactly the strong finish I'd hoped for.\n\nDespite all this, I somehow managed to snag 2nd in my age group - though I'll admit this says more about the field than my performance-. The winner was in a different league altogether, so hats off to him!\n\n![2nd place M40-44.

Looking on the bright side, we now have a baseline for the season. And hey, there's nowhere to go but up from here... right?\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-4d7e7fec10d2ac93989e\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-4d7e7fec10d2ac93989e\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"top\",\"vertical\":false,\"filterHTML\":\"<tr>\\n  <td data-type=\\\"character\\\" style=\\\"vertical-align: top;\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"form-group has-feedback\\\" style=\\\"margin-bottom: auto;\\\">\\n      <input type=\\\"search\\\" placeholder=\\\"All\\\" class=\\\"form-control\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%;\\\"/>\\n      <span class=\\\"glyphicon glyphicon-remove-circle form-control-feedback\\\"><\\/span>\\n    <\\/div>\\n  <\\/td>\\n  <td data-type=\\\"character\\\" style=\\\"vertical-align: top;\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"form-group has-feedback\\\" style=\\\"margin-bottom: auto;\\\">\\n      <input type=\\\"search\\\" placeholder=\\\"All\\\" class=\\\"form-control\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%;\\\"/>\\n      <span class=\\\"glyphicon glyphicon-remove-circle form-control-feedback\\\"><\\/span>\\n    <\\/div>\\n  <\\/td>\\n<\\/tr>\",\"data\":[[\"Final time\",\"Sport 1 time\",\"Sport 2 time\",\"Sport 3 Time\",\"Overall ranking\",\"Gender ranking\",\"Category ranking\",\"Recording device\",\"Activity details\"],[\"01:17:27\",\"00:16:36\",\"00:34:35\",\"00:23:26\",\"12/227\",\"9/123\",\"2/18\",\"GARMIN FORERUNNER 965\",\"<a href=https://asjblog.shinyapps.io/race_shiny/?_inputs_&selector=%222025-06-08%20-%20GRAVENHURST%20SPRINT%20TRIATHLON%20-%20sprint%20triathlon%22>Details<\\/a>\"]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th>GRAVENHURST SPRINT TRIATHLON<\\/th>\\n      <th>sprint triathlon 750m/20K/5K<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"paging\":true,\"pageLength\":10,\"columnDefs\":[{\"name\":\"GRAVENHURST SPRINT TRIATHLON\",\"targets\":0},{\"name\":\"sprint triathlon 750m/20K/5K\",\"targets\":1}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false,\"orderCellsTop\":true}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {layout-ncol=4}\n![Early morning view of Muskoka Lake.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-06-08_GRAVENHURST_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/img/IMG_2017.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![The calm before the storm.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-06-08_GRAVENHURST_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/img/IMG_2018.png){ width=\"100\" group=\"hi\" }\n\n![View from the boat.
