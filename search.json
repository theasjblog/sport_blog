As we all do, by day I navigate the corporate world in a 9-to-5 office job, but my heart truly comes alive when I’m training for my next race.\nWhat You’ll Find Here\nHere, I share my experiences of balancing a full-time career with the demanding world of triathlon training. From early morning swims to lunch-break runs and weekend cycling adventures, I’ll take you through the ups and downs of pursuing athletic goals while maintaining a professional career and personal life. I will include race reports, lessons learnt from the trenches, stories about balancing family time, work responsibilities, and training, and challenges and victories of amateur triathlon.\nJoin Me!\nWhether you’re a fellow age-group triathlete, someone curious about the sport, or just interested in how to balance multiple passions with daily life, I hope you’ll find value in my experiences and insights.

    "text": "Image generated by DALL-E.\n\n\nWhen one season ends, it’s time to take a break—at least a couple of weeks. As the break winds down, I start planning for the next season. In this post, I’ll walk you through my process.\n\nStep 1: Choose the Races\nFor me, the process always starts with selecting the races I want to tackle in the new season. My usual criteria are pretty subjective—proximity, races I’ve enjoyed before, or ones I’ve never tried. However, this year is a bit different.\nSince I qualified for the Age Group World Championship, that race is non-negotiable. From there, I chose races that align with key points in the season where I can gauge my preparation. Another factor I considered was the race course itself. For example, I’m not used to open water swims in the ocean, so I opted for a race in a large body of water to simulate challenging swim conditions.\nHere are the races I selected:\n\nGravenhurst (June 8): The first race of the season. In Canada, races start late, so there aren't many options before this date.\nBracebridge (July 13): A familiar course that provides excellent historical data to measure progress.\nWasaga Beach (August 23): A swim in a large, often windy lake to test my skills in choppy water.\nWollongong (October 17): The World Championship.\n\nI may add one or two smaller races to fine-tune my readiness, but these are the main events.\n\n\nStep 2: Assign Race Priority\nThe next step is assigning a priority to each race, from A (high importance) to C (low importance). This step is crucial because your training schedule—including tapering—depends on these priorities. For example, A races require longer tapering phases, while C races may have little to no taper.\nHere's how I prioritized my races:\n\nGravenhurst: C\nBracebridge: B\nWasaga Beach: C\nWollongong: A\n\n\n\nStep 3: Define Training Blocks\nI'm a big fan of Joe Friel’s periodization system. According to this approach, your training progresses through distinct phases, such as base, build, peak, and taper. Each phase has a specific focus, balancing training volume and intensity while addressing your individual weaknesses.\nIf you're unfamiliar with this system, check out Joe Friel's blog or his book The Triathlete's Training Bible. The TrainingPeaks blog is another excellent resource.\nIn the past, I used a mix of DIY tools to plan my season and sessions. While this was effective, it was also incredibly time-consuming. To simplify things, I started using TrainingPeaks, occasionally purchasing pre-made plans. These plans worked well, and the platform’s analytics were top-notch.\nBut life happens. Illness, work, or other commitments can disrupt even the best-laid plans. Adjusting a pre-made training plan isn’t always easy, and many plans don’t account for changes in your fitness over time. For these reasons, I switched to HumanGo two seasons ago.\nHumanGo is an AI-based virtual coach (named Hugo) that adapts your plan based on your performance and availability. Hugo can adjust your schedule if you need to skip sessions or if your fitness improves. While it’s not perfect—AI can occasionally get things wrong—I’ve seen great results. After all, I qualified for the Age Group World Championship using this system.\n\n\n\nThe 2025 season.\n\n\nIf money were no object, I’d recommend hiring a real-life coach. But for those of us with budget constraints, HumanGo is a fantastic alternative.\n\n\nStep 4: Trust the Process\nOnce your plan is set, the key is to trust it. This can be challenging, especially with a new training system. However, it’s crucial to follow the prescribed workouts—even the easy ones! Avoid the temptation to push harder than necessary, as this can lead to injury or burnout.\nMonitor your progress, and if you’re not improving after a few months, consider making changes. But start from a place of trust. And remember: consistency is the most important factor in improving. Stay consistent by having fun and staying injury-free (again, don’t race your easy workouts!).\nGood luck with your planning, and here’s to a successful 2025 season!"

    "text": "This was a wet one. It rained all the time. Before the race, during, and after. Everything got drenched (pro tip: bring a change to leave in the car, so that it stays dry).\nThis was a race done in preparation of the qualifying ones I will be doing later in the year. The distance was a bit odd (30K bike, 7.5K run), halfway between a sprint and a standard.\nI did a course rec a week before the race, and I knew there was a long and pretty steep raod. That will be interesting to do with wet conditions.\nMy main concern going in was the water temperature. Luckily, the water was perfect. Around 20C. It was a mass start, but a civilized one, so not much fighting at all.\nI just kept telling myself to swim relaxed, don’t go in the red. And I did come out of the water feeling quite good, maybe too good for a race, but still I swam at 1:46/100m, which is better than any other swim race I have ever done.\nThe the bike leg started. The first issue was that I decided to try to keep my shoes attached to the bike this time, but I did not use elastic bands to secure them horizontally. Putting the shoes one while riding was challenging, because they were constantly rotating the wrong way around. Next time, I’ll use elastics. From there, it was again a matter of managing effort. Knowing the challenging course profile and that this was a longer race than a sprint triathlon, I just gauged the effort.\nI was surprised by the grip my Continental tires have. Not a single time on the bike course I felt like the bike could send me off.\nFinally, the run. My legs were not into it at all, and the few hills along the course did not helped. On top of it, a portion of about 2.5K was turned into a mud fest by the rain. Not my preferred running conditions. It was not an horrible run looking at the clock, but for sure it was not a pleasant one.\nAlso, turns out that my fancy carbon plated running shoes can give me blisters wif my feet are wet and there is grit inside the shoes. Not great."

    "text": "I entered this as I did not go into the London Marathon. Ali and I rented a car and drove up to Edinburgh. We stayed in a small B&B near the city center.\nOn race day, it rained in the morning, but not much and it stopped shortly after we started. The race started in city center, and my designated changing space was in a school. I did not drop y bag to the organizers, but I gave to Ali instead. In hindsight, I should have dropped it to the organizers.\nI started off reasonably well, and I stayed strong up until ~30K. But then I had to stop for a wee. And after I stopped, my legs refused to start again. I had to walk for 5K or so. Closer to the end, I managed to get the legs moving again, and at least I finished the day running.\nThe end of the race was in field in the middle of nowhere. Ali was not there, as she was waiting for me in city center, so I did not have my bag. I remember sitting down on the grass for a while, then starting the long walk to the bus shuttle.\nThe day after my legs were quite stiff. Ali had to do the drive back home.\nA tough day, but it was fun. I’m just not sure I want to do another one, and that long stuff is for me. Single sport events in articular, like this one, are boring to prepare, and for months before this race I only did runs, with little to no swimming or cycling.\nAlso, I had to do such a high volume at low intensity, that for years I felt like the marathon training killed my race speed."

    "text": "Another qualifying event. On paper, the route profile for the bike and the run were much easier than Guelph. An almost flat course.\nThe swim was in a canal used for boat racing. I only learnt about this after the race, but something to keep in mind for the next time: the long sides were following the race buoy guides. So, to swim the shortest route possible, just follow the submerged guides. Like swimming in a pool.\nAs I said, I did not know that. I managed to swim fairly straight with a GPS swim distance of 780m, so 30m more than the official distance. At a 2min/100m pace, this would have cost me roughly 25s. We will come back to this later.\nIt was an odd swim. It was swimsuit optional, but for those trying to qualify swimsuits were not allowed. As a result, there was a mixed field of people with and without wetsuit, make it a bit unfair. Also, for those qualifying, the “non westuit” policy will be enforced on a honorary base…\nAnyway, I my swim felt OK. I was controlling my breathing better than in Guelph, and it felt like the water was moving fast next to me. Except, when I got of the water and looked at my watch, I saw a swim time of 17min. WTF! How did that happen?!?\nBut it was no time to think about it. A short run to T1, and off for the bike leg. And here I had a small problem with the pedals. I did attach my shoes with elastics, but the elastics came off too soon, and the shoes did not want to stay up straight. To put them on I had to stop, take them off the pedal, put them on, and start cycling again. It felt like an eternity.\nThen the reality of the bike course hit. It was flat, yes, but very windy. Every second half of each of the 5 laps felt like going uphill. I was catching up a lot of people, but when I was looking at the fast looking guys as a reference it did not look like I was gaining anything on them. Truth be told, most of them were probably under 30, but still…\nFinally, on the run. The route was flat, but made slow but a few sharp corners. And as always, my legs refused to collaborate. In fairness, probably I did push a bit too much on the bike. In places, my watch was telling I was going as slow as 5:05min/Km.\nTotal race time: 1h18m. My slowest sprint triathlon ever.\nAfter some time, I decided to look at the results online. 2nd on the age group! I guess it was a tough race for everyone. And also a reminder to not compare triathlon races with each other: each race is completely different.\nSo that was good. The annoying bit was that I finished 22s behind the first. So close to having a chance to qualify. Makes me wonder what if I swam closer to the 750m? Or what if I did a better T1? Or I pushed just a bit more on the run? Too late know, cannot win races with “what ifs.\nThe last annoying bit of the day was the very long delay for the award: almost 3h between the end of the race and the awards ceremony. An eternity.\nBut I made a friend: the guy who finished 3rd: Robert Eso. We’ll meet again later this year in Berrie."

    "text": "The first race: Heathersage Hilly Triathlon, UK, 2013\n\n\nWelcome!\nI’m a 40-year-old amateur triathlete with a passion for swimming, cycling, and running. By day, I navigate the corporate world in a 9-to-5 office job, but my heart truly comes alive when I’m training for my next race.\nLet’s start with some introduction.\n\nPlanting the triathlon seed\nMy triathlon journey started in 2000 while watching the Summer Olympics—the first time triathlon was included in the schedule. I remember thinking how incredible those athletes were, swimming, then cycling, and then running. It seemed impossible, especially since I couldn’t even swim.\nFast forward to 2012. I was living in Yorkshire, England, where the sport was impossible to ignore, especially with the Brownlee brothers dominating the international scene.\nAt that time, I had started participating in some casual running races. Nothing major, but it was a start.\nThen fate stepped in—someone stole my motorbike. Instead of replacing it, I decided to buy a road bike.\n\n\nRace on!\nThat’s when I decided to give triathlon a shot. I signed up for a local event with a short, pool-based swim and began training. I followed a pre-packaged Garmin plan while learning to swim from scratch.\nI somehow made it to the starting line and, miraculously, to the finish line too. I made every rookie mistake possible: sprinting too hard in the swim and gasping for air after 50m, losing my bike in transition, getting lost on the run course, fumbling with my watch…\nBut none of that mattered. I fell in love with the sport and wanted more.\n\n\nToday\nFast forward to 2024—while much remains the same, everything has also changed. I still love the sport, but I’m now more experienced in my training, albeit older and slower. Between my 9-to-5 job, wife, and two kids, triathlon isn’t my only commitment. I have other hobbies that demand attention too. Balancing everything is a delicate art.\nFollow this blog to join me on my racing journey and see how I manage this balancing act."

The main issue I had was that I could not really see. My googles were leaking pretty badly. As a result, I crushed against another competitor, which a few days later I discovered be Simon, a fellow TriForce club member.\nThe bike was pretty hilly, but nice.\nThe problems started on the run. From very early on, it was clear I had nothing left. I ended up having to walk part of it, with just the occasional jog so that the TriForce photographer could take some action-looking pictures. Good thing I picked the metric and not the imperial Centurion.\nAt the end I stayed on the venue for a bit under the TriForce tent."

I started off on my own, and around the 40K marker I caught a small group. We took turns in front, but it was a bit of a mistake. That made me push a bit too hard too early.\nAt around 100K there was a lunch break. The stands were very well stocked with plenty of options. Past, pizza, fruit, etc. I was not planning to stop for long, so I was mostly worried about avoiding getting my legs to seize up, and overeating. I did not overeat, in hindsight, I should have another serving of pasta.\nA bit after lunch there was the worst part. A long stretch of road on the sun, no shade, slightly uphill. That cooked me good.\nThe last 20K or so were also pretty hard, between the heath and the accumulated tiredness, it was hard to bring the bike home.\nBut I did. Overall a fun day out, even if not my favourite kind of sporting challenge. The only major downside is that cycling events like this are more like a parkrun that a competition. There is plenty of time to chat, but no official timing, ranking, or medal."

I walked into it hoping to do reasonably well, but without any big expectation.\nThe swim was in nice, warm, and calm waters. Also very civilized, with every participant starting alone, with about 5s between each.\nRace numbers and starting time were allocated based on the predicted swim time. As. slow swimmer, I started at the back.\nI choose to swim without wetsuit. Probably I should have used it, just to try to be a bit faster.\nThen we went into to bike. Again, a fairly flat out and back, with just one major but short hill. And that is when I started to notice I was passing a lot of people. Sure, it is hard to know if the person you are passing is doing the same race (the duathlon started at the same time), or if they are in your age group, but still it is good to see numbers even in the low 20s when you started 120th.\nFrom there, on the run. As always, not a great performance on the run. A flat out and back (except for the first 100m with a steep rump to get out of the park). I was still catching people, and a few young (duathletes?) came fly past me.\nAt the end, I did not check the final results. At the time I did not know that in Canada it is normal to have live results you can check on your phone. I just hang around for a while because it was a nice day and to enjoy the atmosphere. I had a feeling maybe I did not so poorly, since I passed so many people, but no way to confirm that. Until the award ceremony. The announcer called in the 3rd guy. Not me. OK I thought, that is it then, I did not do better than 3rd. The announcer called the 2nd. Still not me. But then: “..and in first place, Adrian Joseph!”. That was quite unexpected. I walked up the podium and got my “gold” medal. The award picture shows some inexperience in getting awards: sunglasses were left on, I was wearing my backpack…"

At the end, we just destroyed everyone. It almost wasn’t even fun at then end. Almost…\nI particularly remember two matches.\nIn one, we came close to a brawl. I stole the ball and sprinted away for a solo counterattack, when somebody from the other team decided to just push me on the floor. Memories flushed before my eyes, as that is exactly how I broke one elbow a few years prior. This time, there was no injury, but I sprang up looking for the guy. Luckily he was quick to apologize and it ended there. And I say luckily for myself as well, as he was a bit bigger than me, and I have no experience at all being in a fight, so I don’t think getting into one would have been a great idea anyway.\nThe other match I remember well was a strange one. It was against the class of a guy I was playing against in the provincial teams tournament, and his specialty was 3 points shoots. I have never been a good long range shooter. I have always got out of trouble getting into the paint. The match started with him ding what he was good at, scoring every single long distance shot he was taking. And here is the strange thing. A couple of times I was completely open on the 3 points line, and I took the shot. And I made it. That must have gave me confidence or something, and I started to shoot more and more, and scoring more and more. It ended up almost looking like a 2024 NBA match: a 3 points contest, rather than a basketball game. But that time it worked for us, as we won the match."

    "text": "I’m writing this post a few months after the dust has settled. Back in early 2024, I set a big goal for myself: qualify for the Age Group World Championship for Sprint Triathlon. This decision was fueled partly by the ego boost of winning the Bracebridge race last year (let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a little ego boost?). On top of that, I dug into the winning times from qualifying races over the past 3–4 years. While I wasn’t quite there yet, I figured that with a bit of luck—and maybe some roll-down magic—I might just make it happen.\nFor those unfamiliar, the qualification process in Canada is straightforward on paper but gets tricky when you try to explain it. Let me try anyway.\nFirst, the basics. To qualify, you need to:\n- Be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident.\n- Have a valid Canada Triathlon membership.\n- Race in one of the Canadian qualifying events (technically, you can qualify abroad, but that’s a tougher route).\n- Express your interest by filling out a form and paying a small fee a few days before the race.\nWith those boxes ticked, you’re off to the races. Now, winning the event is obviously great, but it’s not always necessary—or even a guarantee of qualification. Why? Because what really matters is your federation ranking, not the event ranking. And here’s where things get a little funky:\n\nWho’s really in the race?\nYou might not win your event, but if the people who beat you aren’t racing to qualify—or aren’t eligible—they don’t count in the federation ranking.\nAge shuffling madness.\nThe federation ranking is based on the next calendar year’s world championship. So, while the event uses your age as of 2024, the federation looks at your age as of 2025. This means people might move up to the next age group, which can reshuffle the rankings in surprising ways.\n\nBasically, if you want to be absolutely sure you’ve qualified, you need to be the fastest in both your age group and the one below it. No pressure, right?\nOh, and did I mention that in Ontario, we have only three qualifying races, with just one slot per age group at each? Simple to understand? Maybe. Simple to explain? Not so much.\nNow, back to my 2024 season. The three qualifying events were Guelph, Welland, and Barrie. Things didn’t start great—I finished 5\\(^{th}\\) in both Guelph and Barrie. Welland went better, where I snagged 2\\(^{nd}\\) place, but two younger athletes also posted faster times. So, I had three people ahead of me, leaving my qualification chances looking slim.\nBy September 11\\(^{th}\\), I still hadn’t heard from the federation and assumed it wasn’t happening. I’d already started planning a more laid-back 2025, given how demanding this season had been. After dinner, I was casually cleaning out my spam inbox (as one does), and there it was—a message from the federation: I got a direct qualification spot!\nCue panic. I had until September 13\\(^{th}\\) to confirm, and apparently, I’d missed earlier emails that also ended up in spam. A quick chat with my wife followed—this was an expensive and poorly-timed opportunity, but how often do you get the chance to represent your adoptive country on the world stage? We decided it was worth it.\nSo, Wollongong, here I come!"

    "text": "Back racing in Bracebridge after the 2023 Age Group victory. However, defending the title would have not been easy, as a quick look at the people around me in transition was suggesting a much more competitive field than the 2023 race.\nI was given the number 22, as opposed to the 120 i had last year. This means I could not get the moral boost of catching people. I mostly had the pressure to not be caught.\nThe swim felt OK. I opted to swim with the wetsuit (in 2023 I did not use it). It turns out my swim was almost 1m slower this year. It could be because of a stronger current on the second half of the swim, but maybe I just need to get better at swimming with a wetsuit, and to push harder for the 750m of the swim.\nIn T1 I opted to leave the shoes on the ground, not on the bike. I did this because I struggled with a running mount on my last race, and I knew that the bike leg started uphill, immediately followed by a 90deg corner and a 180 deg corner, leaving little time to fiddle with shoes. So I decided to not put the shoes on the bike, and just do a run dismount into T2. I think it worked out OK.\nThen the bike. As always, I felt strong on the bike, and I was catching people up, although I did not know their age group or even if they were racing in the triathlon or the duathlon.\nFinally, the run. I knew the run started with a 200 uphill, so I took it easy there. I then went steady, focusing on keeping ~340W, which felt manageable. At around the 3K marker I caught up with a guy that had 43 written on his calf. He was in my age group. I passed him and I heard him trying to stay with me. I was hoping he gave up, because I did not have much more left to react to a defensive move. Luckily, he did not have anything left. He was the guy that ended up 3rd in the age group, about 1m behind me.\nAt the end I finished in 1h15m54s. About 1.5m faster than last year. of this 90s, about 60came form the bike and 30 came from the run. In the swim I lost time. Both transitions were also faster.\nAs for the ranking, I could not defend my 2023 title. The guy who finished first, and Australian, was way faster in every discipline. He was about 3min faster on the swim, 2min faster on the bike, and 1m faster on the run. I might be able to get to run at that pace, and with a similarly spech’ed bike I might be able to post the same time, but the swim was just way too fast for me. I really need to find a way to work on my swim if I want to step up the game."

    "text": "My first triathlon. Organized by the Sheffield Triathlon Club in Hathersage, in the middle of the Peak District. A great place. I do not remember the distances exactly, but they were a bit odd, somewhere in between a sprint and a standard, except for the swim that was a short one in a heated outdoor pool. The main “selling” point was that, has the name implies and because of the venue (the Peak District), it was “hilly”. Very hilly…\nI went to this race with my girlfriend. I rented a car that was too small for the job, but somehow I managed to fit the bike in the boot. We got there very early, even before most of the marshals. It was nice to see the calm water of the pool before anyone had the chance to jump in or to set up the lanes.\nI set up the bike in T1 and the run kit in T2 (they had different transition zones), double and triple checking I had everything I needed laid out. I then went to the race briefing listening to every world, even if it was the usual obvious stuff (shared roads, dismount line, rack the bike before you take the helmet off, etc.).\nWhen the race started I was quite nervous, not knowing if I had it in me to finish a triathlon race. At the time I did not have a multi-sport watch. I was planning to swim with the Garmin Swim, and then change over to another watch. Except in the excitement of the first race I messed up everything. To this day I am not sure with what piece of tech I finished the race…\nAnyway, the swim went as good as it could have: I did not drawn and I finished it. The bike was OK. A challenging route, with plenty of hills and wind, but fun. The real problems started with T2. After I chenged into my running gear, I guess I started to pay my dues to the inexperience. First I could not find the exit to the run. I had to ask my girlfriend where I had to go. Finally, I was out running. But not for long. Very quickly, the run started to feel more like an orienteering race than a triathlon race. The idea was to run up and down into the woods on a hill. Except there was little to no signalling or marshaling. I got lost a couple of time and my watch told me I did almost 1Km more than I was supposed to. It was of little consolation knowing that I was not the only one. I remember seeing people that somehow ended up running on a road well out of the running route…\nAll in all, it was a good and fun race. I have never done it again because I was not a fun of the hilly run with poor marking, but if that is you jam, go for it, you won’t regret doing the Hathersage Hilly Triathlon."

I hadn’t even realized I was competing in a series – talk about a pleasant surprise!\nLooking at those point totals now – 90 (Welland), 90 (Bracebridge), and 75 (Barrie) – each number represents a story, a race where I pushed my limits and competed against not just others, but myself. That second-place finishe in Welland is particularly special: that was the race that gave the slot for the Age Group World Championship.\nBut beyond the points and placements, what really makes this achievement special is what it represents: consistency, dedication, and the pure joy of competing. To think that my performance across these three races was strong enough to clinch the series title – it’s honestly still sinking in!\nAnd now, as I hold this plaque in my hands (after its adventure through the Canada Post strike!), I can’t help but feel even more motivated for what’s ahead. This isn’t just a recognition of past achievements; it’s fuel for future goals, especially as I prepare for the Age Group World Championship.\n\n\n\nTop M40-44 in the series."

    "text": "This was the last qualifying event of the season. It was an early start. To be in Barrie at 6am, I left at 4am from Burlington.\nIt was a cold morning. So cold that the water temperature went was down to 16C from the 20C of the day before, and with the water that cold it was a westsuit mandatory race. A few people did not have wetsuit, and they got moved to the duathlon race. This probably messed up the results (more on this later).\nRob Eso, the guy I met in Welland (he finished third), was there too. So one of my main objective was to finish ahead of him.\nI was not feeling 100%, but I started off reasonably well. I closed the swim in just over 14min. Nothing incredible, but pretty decent for me.\nI got to transition and I could not see Rob’s bike. I though he must have out swam me, which in fairness is a fairly easy thing to do.\nT1 was not great, as with cold feet and cold hands it was a struggle to get the wetsuit off. Once again, I opted to put the shoes on, and not leave them on the bike, which worked out OK.\nOff to the bike leg. 4 laps on very fast and very fast tarmac. I probably did not push out enough watts, but I still kept an average speed of about 37km/h. I was seeing Rob on some the straight, and I noticed I was catching up, but not fast enough. Damn! I though, he must have had a killer swim to be so much ahead.\nThen we got to T2. Again I did not see Rob’s bike there, which I found really strange. But off to run I went. As always, I did not feel fast at all, but it turned out to be a 22min run, which is in line with all the other runs of the season. During the straights, I saw Rob again, He was surprisingly behind, and he looked like he was not going particularly fast.\nAnd finally, the finish line.\nI checked the results: 5\\(^{th}\\) in the Age Group. A bit disappointing, since a 5\\(^{th}\\) place is not going to give a spot, but I need to remember that I cannot control who shows up the races, only what I do. And clearly in this race there were a lot of strong people.\nBut back to the mess of the timing for a second. Many official records, including mine, are incomplete, mostly missing the bike leg. For example, my record has a 14min swim, no bike, and a 53min run. Clearly, the run includes the bike leg as well.\nThe official records also say I finished 6\\(^{th}\\), not 5\\(^{th}\\). But when I look at the results of the guy who finished first, they are just not believable for a sprint triathlon from a 40-ish years old. First of all, the total time was 1h1min. Which would be a time that can compete with a 25 years old pro. Second, he also was missing the bike record, but his swim leg was 20min, and his run leg was 40min. Now, if you swim in 20min, you are unlikely fit enough to do a 20K bike and a 5K run in 40min. On top of that, 40min for a 20K bike and a 5K run would be an insanely fast split for an amateur 40-ish years old triathlete. Personally, I believe he did a duathlon instead. In that case, the first 20min would be for the 5K run, and the remaining 40min for the 20K bike and the 2.5K run, which is reasonable.\nFinally, back to Rob. Turns out he swam in 15min, so I won there, then he cycled at 36km/h (again, point for me), but he messed up because he did 5 laps instead of 4. That took some wind out of his sail and finished the run in 23min. That sucks. I did that mistake in Birmingham years ago, and I know it is infuriating."

A bit slower maybe than I would have liked, but the mass start did no help. I was not used to that anymore.\nAfter the swim we had a long hike to transition. A small fight with the wetsuit, and I was off on the bike.\nMounting was smoother than the previous race (Milton): using the elastic to keep the shoes in place was a good idea.\nThe bike was uneventful, just a lot of inexperienced riders on the road to overtake. Maybe a bit too hilly for my likening. Not big hills, just. a lot of up and downs. The main issue I had on the bike was that about 1KM in I realized I had lost my water bottle straw because of the bumpy road surface. So I just got thirsty from there on.\nOn the last kilometer or so of the bike I caught up with the guy in front on on my age group. I opted to pass him, spending a few extra energy.\nI did not stay ahead for long. He was a much stronger runner. He finished the run in something around 19min.\nOverall the race was not bad. I set a new PB for the distance, improving the old one by around 2min, and I finished less than 4min behind the age category winner, so much closer than in the past.\nAs a qualifying event, I would have liked to finish higher up, but I cannot control who show up to a race.
