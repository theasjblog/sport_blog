**Welcome to my blog!**

I'm a 40-year-old amateur triathlete. As we all do, by day I navigate the corporate world in a 9-to-5 office job, but my heart truly comes alive when I'm training for my next race.

**What You'll Find Here**

Here, I share my experiences of balancing a full-time career with the demanding world of triathlon training. From early morning swims to lunch-break runs and weekend cycling adventures, I'll take you through the ups and downs of pursuing athletic goals while maintaining a professional career and personal life. I will include race reports, lessons learnt from the trenches, stories about balancing family time, work responsibilities, and training, and challenges and victories of amateur triathlon.

**Join Me!**

Whether you're a fellow age-group triathlete, someone curious about the sport, or just interested in how to balance multiple passions with daily life, I hope you'll find value in my experiences and insights. Follow along as I share my journey of swimming, biking, and running through life!
