When I was a kid I was going to summer and winter camps organized by some religious organisation. This particular one was a summer camp in the Alps, in S. Martino Di Castrozza. Within the summer camp, there was a soccer tournament between teams of different camps. I do not have too many memory about, I do not even remember if I was playing goalkeeper, defender, or striker. Most likely defender, but I could not guarantee it. But two things I do remember: it was a gravel football pitch behind a church, and, more importantly: we won the tournament!
