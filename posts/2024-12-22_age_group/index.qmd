I’m writing this post a few months after the dust has settled. Back in early 2024, I set a big goal for myself: qualify for the Age Group World Championship for Sprint Triathlon. This decision was fueled partly by the ego boost of winning the [Bracebridge](../2023-07-09_BRACEBRIDGE_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/index.qmd) race last year (let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a little ego boost?). On top of that, I dug into the winning times from qualifying races over the past 3–4 years. While I wasn’t quite there yet, I figured that with a bit of luck—and maybe some roll-down magic—I might just make it happen.  

For those unfamiliar, the qualification process in Canada is straightforward on paper but gets tricky when you try to explain it. Let me try anyway.  

First, the basics. To qualify, you need to:  
- Be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident.  
- Have a valid Canada Triathlon membership.  
- Race in one of the Canadian qualifying events (technically, you can qualify abroad, but that’s a tougher route).  
- Express your interest by filling out a form and paying a small fee a few days before the race.  

With those boxes ticked, you’re off to the races. Now, winning the event is obviously great, but it’s not always necessary—or even a guarantee of qualification. Why? Because what really matters is your *federation ranking,* not the event ranking. And here’s where things get a little funky:  

1. **Who’s really in the race?**  
   You might not win your event, but if the people who beat you aren’t racing to qualify—or aren’t eligible—they don’t count in the federation ranking.  

2. **Age shuffling madness.**  
   The federation ranking is based on the *next* calendar year’s world championship. So, while the event uses your age as of 2024, the federation looks at your age as of 2025. This means people might move up to the next age group, which can reshuffle the rankings in surprising ways.  

Basically, if you want to be absolutely sure you’ve qualified, you need to be the fastest in both your age group *and* the one below it. No pressure, right?  

Oh, and did I mention that in Ontario, we have only *three* qualifying races, with just one slot per age group at each? Simple to understand? Maybe. Simple to explain? Not so much.  

Now, back to my 2024 season. The three qualifying events were [Guelph](../2024-06-16_GUELPH_LAKE_1_SUBARU_TRIATHLON/index.qmd), [Welland](../2024-06-23_WELLAND_ROSE_CITY_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/index.qmd), and [Barrie](../2024-08-11_BARRIE_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/index.qmd). Things didn’t start great—I finished 5$^{th}$ in both Guelph and Barrie. Welland went better, where I snagged 2$^{nd}$ place, but two younger athletes also posted faster times. So, I had three people ahead of me, leaving my qualification chances looking slim.  

By September 11$^{th}$, I still hadn’t heard from the federation and assumed it wasn’t happening. I’d already started planning a more laid-back 2025, given how demanding this season had been. After dinner, I was casually cleaning out my spam inbox (as one does), and there it was—a message from the federation: **I got a direct qualification spot!**  

Cue panic. I had until September 13$^{th}$ to confirm, and apparently, I’d missed earlier emails that also ended up in spam. A quick chat with my wife followed—this was an expensive and poorly-timed opportunity, but how often do you get the chance to represent your adoptive country on the world stage? We decided it was worth it.  

So, Wollongong, here I come!
