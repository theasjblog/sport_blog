While I was living in Hemel Hemsptead, UK, I was part of the triathlon club Triforce. Every year, we organized the club champs. Pretty unofficial and on run on a honest based system, which is fair, since the main point of the day was to build some camaraderie and just have some fun.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
race_date <- "2017-09-24"

source('../../../inst/aux_functions.R')

DT::datatable(get_summary_data(arrow::read_parquet('https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport/parquets/main_dataset.parquet') |>
  filter(as.character(event_date) == race_date)),
              rownames = FALSE,
              filter = 'top',
              selection = 'single',
              escape = FALSE,
              options = list(
                paging =TRUE,
                pageLength =  10
              ))
```
