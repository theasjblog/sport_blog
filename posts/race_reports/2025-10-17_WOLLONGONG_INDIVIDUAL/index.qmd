## üåä The Race of a Lifetime

For years I had dreamed of this moment ‚Äî racing at the **World Championships**, wearing the maple leaf on my suit.  
Months and years of structured training, long hours, early mornings ‚Äî everything led to this.

I reached the start line with excitement, pride‚Ä¶ and a bit of fatigue. The travel, the walking around Wollongong, and all the pre-race logistics had taken their toll. Still, the adrenaline of being here overpowered everything else.

## üéí The Days Before

I collected my race pack the very first day: arm and calf stickers, swim cap, bike and helmet numbers, a transition bag, a nice backpack, a beach towel, and a *Welcome to Wollongong* booklet.  
The next day, I dropped off my bike for the mandatory pre-race check ‚Äî with **1,260 athletes** in the sprint alone, this keeps things organized.

On the way there, I got my first omen: the bike squeaked and cracked with every pedal stroke. Not ideal.

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Race Morning

For once, I didn‚Äôt have to wake up at 4 a.m. My start was at **10:45**, pure luxury.  
I had a calm breakfast, applied my number stickers, and walked to transition.

There, surrounded by incredibly fit athletes from all over the world, it was easy to feel out of place. I reminded myself to stick to my plan and not get distracted.  
My setup was dialed in: bike shoes clipped and held by elastics, helmet with sunglasses on the bars, running shoes with a gel tucked inside, race belt ready, and Vaseline around the shoe entry for a fast slip-in.

After some dynamic stretching and elastic-band warm-up, I dropped my bag and headed toward the swim start.

## üèä Swim ‚Äî Chaos in the Harbour

A surprise awaited us: due to high waves, the course was moved **inside the harbour**. For a weaker swimmer like me, that was a relief.

I warmed up briefly in the water, then lined up with my wave ‚Äî **76 athletes**, shoulder to shoulder.  
The speaker‚Äôs words echoed: *‚ÄúAthletes, you are now in the hands of the starter.‚Äù*  
Heartbeats. Silence. The horn blasted.

Chaos. Bodies everywhere. Some swimmers veered off course, making it hard to stay straight.  
I kept calm, knowing that going too hard early would only lead to fading later.

I exited the water **56th of 76** ‚Äî far from the front, but I wasn‚Äôt last, and more importantly, I made the cutoff I had been worried about.

## üö¥ Bike ‚Äî Two Loops of Noise

Transition was long ‚Äî nearly **400 m** from swim exit to bike mount ‚Äî but it went smoothly for once.

The bike course had two loops: a technical first half with small hills, then a flat, fast stretch back. Perfect variety.

I tried to stay with a group early on, but when they pushed the pace, I let them go.  
I didn‚Äôt want to repeat past mistakes of blowing up before the run.  
I settled around **249 W**, slightly below my **255 W goal**, but steady.

The only problem: my bike sounded like it was falling apart ‚Äî constant squeaks and cracks.  
I prayed it would hold together to the end.

## üèÉ Run ‚Äî Holding It Together

T2 was quick, no drama.

My legs felt heavier than I hoped, but I focused on rhythm.  
The run course had rolling hills and heat, and I maintained a **4:30 min/km** pace ‚Äî not spectacular, but consistent.  
I even managed to pick it up in the last 500 m.

Then came the **blue carpet** ‚Äî that magical final stretch.  
Crossing the finish arch with a World Championship medal around my neck was a moment I‚Äôll never forget.

## üá®üá¶ Little Rivalries

I had two ‚Äúrivals‚Äù in mind:  
- A Canadian I met at swim familiarization ‚Äî confident and strong in the water. I ended up beating him.  
- Another Canadian from the bike group that had dropped me. I reeled him in on the run and passed him in the final lap, finishing about **10 seconds ahead**.

Two small, personal wins that made the day even sweeter.

## üèÅ Results and Reflections

I finished **56th of 77**. Not spectacular on paper, but in context ‚Äî this was the **world‚Äôs best amateur field**, every athlete here having earned their spot.

My time of **1:15:35** was solid, even a bit faster than my season average given the heat and course difficulty.  
I also finished **2nd of 6 Canadians** ‚Äî a proud result.

Looking back at my goals:

- **Top 10%** ‚Üí not met, but a poor metric anyway since it depends on who shows up.  
- **Time goal (1:10‚Äì1:20)** ‚Üí met halfway at 1:15:35.  
- **Don‚Äôt fade on the run** ‚Üí ‚úÖ  
- **Not last** ‚Üí ‚úÖ  
- **Top 3 Canadians** ‚Üí ‚úÖ  

Most importantly, I executed my plan.  
I raced smart, steady, and left the finish line with a smile instead of a grimace.  
That, to me, is a success.
