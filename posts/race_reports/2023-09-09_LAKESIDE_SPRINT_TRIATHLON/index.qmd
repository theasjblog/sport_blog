This was the second triathlon after the Covid break. It was part of the Multisport Canada series, the same as Bracebridge, which I won a few months earlier. I walked into it with some good hope.

Turns out, it was. a lot more competitive that Bracebridge. I still finished faster than Bracebridge, but i was nowhere near the top 3.

The swim was on calm, warm water, so no problem there.

The bike and the run routes had a couple of minor hills, but overall a quite fast race.

As always, the post race was great. Multisport Canada really knows how to put together an after race party. Plenty of choices between pizza, energy bars, fruit, etc.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(DT)
if(file.exists(file.path('data.json'))){
  tmp <- jsonlite::fromJSON(file.path('data.json'))
    breakdown <- tmp$breakdown
    tmp$breakdown <- NULL
    tmp <- as.data.frame(tmp) %>%
      dplyr::bind_cols(breakdown)

    details <- unlist(tmp$details)
    if(!is.null(details)){
      details <- paste0('<a href="',
                        details, '">Link to activity file</a>')
      details_names <- paste0('details_', seq(1, length(details)))
    } else {
      details_names <- NULL
    }

    tmp$details <- NULL


    df <- as.data.frame(t(tmp)) %>%
      dplyr::bind_rows(data.frame(V1 = details))

    df <- data.frame('  ' = c(colnames(tmp), details_names),
                     ' ' = df,
                     check.names = FALSE)
    colnames(df) <- NULL


    datatable(df,
              rownames = FALSE,
              selection = 'single',
              escape = FALSE,
              options = list(
                paging =TRUE,
                pageLength =  20
              ))
}
```
