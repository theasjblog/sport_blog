This was a tough one. I prepared for it by progressively hitting 100K to 120K rides, but 160K is something different.

The route was very flat, except for two short but brutal uphill. I started off on my own, and around the 40K marker I caught a small group. We took turns in front, but it was a bit of a mistake. That made me push a bit too hard too early.

At around 100K there was a lunch break. The stands were very well stocked with plenty of options. Past, pizza, fruit, etc. I was not planning to stop for long, so I was mostly worried about avoiding getting my legs to seize up, and overeating. I did not overeat, in hindsight, I should have another serving of pasta.

A bit after lunch there was the worst part. A long stretch of road on the sun, no shade, slightly uphill. That cooked me good.

The last 20K or so were also pretty hard, between the heath and the accumulated tiredness, it was hard to bring the bike home.

But I did. Overall a fun day out, even if not my favourite kind of sporting challenge. The only major downside is that cycling events like this are more like a parkrun that a competition. There is plenty of time to chat, but no official timing, ranking, or medal.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(DT)
if(file.exists(file.path('data.json'))){
  tmp <- jsonlite::fromJSON(file.path('data.json'))
    breakdown <- tmp$breakdown
    tmp$breakdown <- NULL
    tmp <- as.data.frame(tmp) %>%
      dplyr::bind_cols(breakdown)

    details <- unlist(tmp$details)
    if(!is.null(details)){
      details <- paste0('<a href="',
                        details, '">Link to activity file</a>')
      details_names <- paste0('details_', seq(1, length(details)))
    } else {
      details_names <- NULL
    }

    tmp$details <- NULL


    df <- as.data.frame(t(tmp)) %>%
      dplyr::bind_rows(data.frame(V1 = details))

    df <- data.frame('  ' = c(colnames(tmp), details_names),
                     ' ' = df,
                     check.names = FALSE)
    colnames(df) <- NULL


    datatable(df,
              rownames = FALSE,
              selection = 'single',
              escape = FALSE,
              options = list(
                paging =TRUE,
                pageLength =  20
              ))
}
```
