Not much memories on this. Just that I got there way too early, it was raining, and I had to wait in the car while they opened registration. Also, there was no changing rooms, everybody was getting ready in a gym hall.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
race_date <- "2019-11-17"

source('../../../inst/aux_functions.R')

DT::datatable(get_summary_data(race_date),
              rownames = FALSE,
              filter = 'top',
              selection = 'single',
              escape = FALSE,
              options = list(
                paging =TRUE,
                pageLength =  10
              ))
```
