Graves park is a park in Sheffield, UK. As the names suggests, it is near an old cemetery, which s a bit of an odd venue for a race. Regardless, the event is a nice one. The park is pretty, and race is a hilly one, ran on a mix of grass and gravel.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
race_date <- "2011-07-15"

source('../../../inst/aux_functions.R')

DT::datatable(get_summary_data(race_date),
              rownames = FALSE,
              filter = 'top',
              selection = 'single',
              escape = FALSE,
              options = list(
                paging =TRUE,
                pageLength =  10
              ))
```
