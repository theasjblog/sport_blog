This was the first time I tried to qualify for the Age Group. It did not happen. Also, slightly annoying finishing 6th, when the first 5 were called up to the podium...

Anyway, I managed the swim fairly well. A bit slower maybe than I would have liked, but the mass start did no help. I was not used to that anymore.

After the swim we had a long hike to transition. A small fight with the wetsuit, and I was off on the bike.

Mounting was smoother than the previous race (Milton): using the  elastic to keep the shoes in place was a good idea.

The bike was uneventful, just a lot of inexperienced riders on the road to overtake. Maybe a bit too hilly for my likening. Not big hills, just. a lot of up and downs.
The main issue I had on the bike was that about 1KM in I realized I had lost my water bottle straw because of the bumpy road surface. So I just got thirsty from there on.

On the last kilometer or so of the bike I caught up with the guy in front on on my age group. I opted to pass him, spending a few extra energy.

I did not stay ahead for long. He was a much stronger runner. He finished the run in something around 19min.

Overall the race was not bad. I set a new PB for the distance, improving the old one by around 2min, and I finished less than 4min behind the age category winner, so much closer than in the past.

As a qualifying event, I would have liked to finish higher up, but I cannot control who show up to a race. I just need to focus on how I executed the race plan.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(DT)
if(file.exists(file.path('data.json'))){
  tmp <- jsonlite::fromJSON(file.path('data.json'))
    breakdown <- tmp$breakdown
    tmp$breakdown <- NULL
    tmp <- as.data.frame(tmp) %>%
      dplyr::bind_cols(breakdown)

    details <- unlist(tmp$details)
    if(!is.null(details)){
      details <- paste0('<a href="',
                        details, '">Link to activity file</a>')
      details_names <- paste0('details_', seq(1, length(details)))
    } else {
      details_names <- NULL
    }

    tmp$details <- NULL


    df <- as.data.frame(t(tmp)) %>%
      dplyr::bind_rows(data.frame(V1 = details))

    df <- data.frame('  ' = c(colnames(tmp), details_names),
                     ' ' = df,
                     check.names = FALSE)
    colnames(df) <- NULL


    datatable(df,
              rownames = FALSE,
              selection = 'single',
              escape = FALSE,
              options = list(
                paging =TRUE,
                pageLength =  20
              ))
}
```
