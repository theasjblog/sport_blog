# Testing the Legs at Parkrun – With a Dash of Triathlon Prep

This morning’s mission: a 5K parkrun to fine-tune my training zones and see just how ready (or not!) I am for the Sprint Triathlon Age Group World Championship in Wollongong.

Lately, running and I haven’t exactly been best friends. I’ve been slogging through a series of 22-minute-plus 5Ks, and with a brand-new coach in my corner (more on that drama soon), I was curious—could I sneak under 22 minutes again? Maybe even flirt with 21?

This was my debut at this particular parkrun venue. It’s one of those Goldilocks events: popular enough for a buzz, but not so packed that you spend the whole time dodging elbows. The course is a flat, three-lap loop around a pond—no hills, no hairpin turns, just you, your legs, and the clock. Basically, a recipe for speed… if you don’t get carried away.

Which I promptly did.

I blasted off way too hard, hitting 4:50/km for the first 2K, fully aware I’d lit the matchbook a little too soon. I tucked in behind a speedy young woman for a while, but she eventually glided away like it was nothing. My pace crept above 4:20/km, but mercifully the finish line was getting close. A few runners caught me, but I crossed in 20:39—comfortably under my goal and my fastest 5K since 2016. Not exactly Olympic-qualifying stuff, but for me, a sweet little victory.

Post-race, the parkrun magic kicked in. That friendly, chatty vibe is one of the reasons I love these events. Several people came over to ask about my *St. Albans Striders* vest, which turned into some great conversations.

So now, with my confidence slightly restored and my legs reminded they can still turn over quickly, it’s back to the grind. Wollongong is calling.
