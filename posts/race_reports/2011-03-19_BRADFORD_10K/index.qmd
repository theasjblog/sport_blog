My first solo 10K. Bradford is a town in Yorkshire, UK. I rode my motorbike there since there was a big car park near the race start, and it always easy to park a motorbike anyway. There was no real changing room, so it was a good thing that I was wearing my running gear under motorbike outfit. On the plus side, the baggage area was inside the town hall, a stereotypical old English large building fully carpeted, with a grand wooden and marble staircase, and old portraits of distinguished gentlemen everywhere.

The race itself was flat and fast, with a long stretch to the finish, even a bit downhill. I remember gathering all my renaming strength and sprinting to the finish line, a move that became an hallmark of my races later on and that I was using all the time to try to get past someone I was trying to chase down for the whole race.

## Summary
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
race_date <- "2011-03-19"

source('../../../inst/aux_functions.R')

id <- arrow::read_parquet('https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport/parquets/main_dataset.parquet') |>
  collect() |>
  filter(as.character(EVENT_DATE) == race_date) |>
  pull(ID)

df <- get_summary_data(arrow::read_parquet('https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport/parquets/all_results.parquet') |>
  filter(ID == id) |>
  filter(ATHLETE == "ADRIAN JOSEPH"))

DT::datatable(df,
              rownames = FALSE,
              filter = 'top',
              selection = 'single',
              escape = FALSE,
              options = list(
                paging =TRUE,
                pageLength =  10
              ))
```
