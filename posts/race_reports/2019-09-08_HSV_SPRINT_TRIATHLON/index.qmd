A pool-based one, in the pool where I was training with the Tri-Force. I never particularly liked pool triathlon, and this was no exception. The race was flat and fast.

I remember transition being simply biked leaned against the pool wall, and then in the run we had to go through a filed with cows. I remember a guy wearing Team GB kit being quite scared.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
race_date <- "2019-09-08"

source('../../../inst/aux_functions.R')

DT::datatable(get_summary_data(arrow::read_parquet('https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport/parquets/main_dataset.parquet') |>
  filter(as.character(event_date) == race_date)),
              rownames = FALSE,
              filter = 'top',
              selection = 'single',
              escape = FALSE,
              options = list(
                paging =TRUE,
                pageLength =  10
              ))
```
