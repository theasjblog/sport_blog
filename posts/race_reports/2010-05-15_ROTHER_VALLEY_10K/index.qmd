Rother Valley is a pretty park with a lake in the middle in Rotheram, UK. This race was a loop around the lake. This was my second ever 10K race, and I remember it was harder than the first one (it was also about 4min faster). My housemate and I took the bus from Sheffield and headed down to Rother Valley for the race. All in all, a good race venue and a good race.

## Summary

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
race_date <- "2010-05-15"

source('../../../inst/aux_functions.R')

id <- arrow::read_parquet('https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport/parquets/main_dataset.parquet') |>
  collect() |>
  filter(as.character(EVENT_DATE) == race_date) |>
  pull(ID)

df <- get_summary_data(arrow::read_parquet('https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport/parquets/all_results.parquet') |>
  filter(ID == id) |>
  filter(ATHLETE == "ADRIAN JOSEPH"))

DT::datatable(df,
              rownames = FALSE,
              filter = 'top',
              selection = 'single',
              escape = FALSE,
              options = list(
                paging =TRUE,
                pageLength =  10
              ))
```
