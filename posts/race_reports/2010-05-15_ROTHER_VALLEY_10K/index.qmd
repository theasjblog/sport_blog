Rother Valley is a pretty park with a lake in the middle in Rotheram, UK. This race was a loop around the lake. This was my second ever 10K race, and I remember it was harder than the first one (it was also about 4min faster). My housemate and I took the bus from Sheffield and headed down to Rother Valley for the race. All in all, a good race venue and a good race.
