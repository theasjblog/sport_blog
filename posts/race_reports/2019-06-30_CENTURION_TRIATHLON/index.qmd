This was the first attempt at a long-ish distance, with the added difficulties of not being really trained for it.

The swim was OK. Nothing special, but I managed. The main issue I had was that I could not really see. My googles were leaking pretty badly. As a result, I crushed against another competitor, which a few days later I discovered be Simon, a fellow TriForce club member.

The bike was pretty hilly, but nice.

The problems started on the run. From very early on, it was clear I had nothing left. I ended up having to walk part of it, with just the occasional jog so that the TriForce photographer could take some action-looking pictures. Good thing I picked the metric and not the imperial Centurion.

At the end I stayed on the venue for a bit under the TriForce tent.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
race_date <- "2019-06-30"

source('../../../inst/aux_functions.R')

DT::datatable(get_summary_data(race_date),
              rownames = FALSE,
              filter = 'top',
              selection = 'single',
              escape = FALSE,
              options = list(
                paging =TRUE,
                pageLength =  10
              ))
```
