This was another one of my home races, in Sheffield, UK. The starting line was in city center, near the Crucible.The race was the biggest one I have ever done to this time, with thousands of people taking part. It was an almost flat route, except for a downhill start, and an uphill finish.

The added bit of fun was that participants could choose to participate for the White Rose or the Red Rose, a reminiscence of the War of the Roses.

Because the race was run reasonably close to city center, it was full of people cheering and bands, which was very motivational.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
race_date <- "2011-10-13"

source('../../../inst/aux_functions.R')

id <- arrow::read_parquet('https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport/parquets/main_dataset.parquet') |>
  collect() |>
  filter(as.character(EVENT_DATE) == race_date) |>
  pull(ID)

df <- get_summary_data(arrow::read_parquet('https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport/parquets/all_results.parquet') |>
  filter(ID == id) |>
  filter(ATHLETE == "ADRIAN JOSEPH"))

DT::datatable(df,
              rownames = FALSE,
              filter = 'top',
              selection = 'single',
              escape = FALSE,
              options = list(
                paging =TRUE,
                pageLength =  10
              ))
```
