A challenging and fun obstacle race in the Yorkshire. Denis and I drove up there and ran the course together. Personally I think that the Sheffield Man Of Steel was a better event, but there is nothing wrong with this. They definitely make use of the larger budget by building larger obstacles over a wider field.

At the end there was beer and to shower we had to use freezing cold water coming out of a pipe they used to get drinking water for the horses.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(DT)
library(hms)
library(dplyr)
library(arrow)

dateIs <- "2012-07-04"
df <- arrow::read_parquet('https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport/parquets/main_dataset.parquet') |>
  filter(event_date == dateIs)# |>

final <- data.frame(
  "Race type" = paste0(df$event_type, " ", df$event_distance),
  "Final time" = hms::as_hms(df$result_total),
  "Overall ranking" = paste0(df$ranking_overall, "/", df$participants_overall),
  "Gender ranking" = paste0(df$ranking_gender, "/", df$participants_gender),
  "Category ranking" = paste0(df$ranking_category, "/", df$participants_category)
)

final <- t(final)

final <- data.frame(
  col1 = gsub("\\.", " ", rownames(final)),
  col2 = final[,1], 
  row.names = NULL
) |>
  filter(!is.na(col2)) |>
  filter(col2 != "NA/NA") |>
  mutate(
    col2 = gsub("NA", "-", col2)
  )
  

colnames(final) <- c(df$event_name, final$col2[1])
final <- final[-1,]

datatable(
  final,
  rownames = FALSE,                 # Don't show row names
  options = list(
    #    dom = 't',                      # Show only the table body (no search, no pagination, no header)
    ordering = FALSE                # Optional: disable sorting
  )
)
```
