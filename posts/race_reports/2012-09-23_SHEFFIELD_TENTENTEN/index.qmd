Another home race in Sheffield, UK. This one was in the Endcliff area. It rained the day before, which was not great for a race run almost entirely on woods. I did not like this at all, as I did not like running on slippery mud.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
race_date <- "2012-09-23"

source('../../../inst/aux_functions.R')

DT::datatable(get_summary_data(race_date),
              rownames = FALSE,
              filter = 'top',
              selection = 'single',
              escape = FALSE,
              options = list(
                paging =TRUE,
                pageLength =  10
              ))
```
