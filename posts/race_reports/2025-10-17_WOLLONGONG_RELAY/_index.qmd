description: "Four athletes, four mini-triathlons, and one big grin: how our improvised Team Canada III (X160) raced the Mixed Team Relay at the Wollongong World Championships."
---

> If the individual race was the “main event,” the mixed team relay was the fun, social one — yet no less exciting.

For those unfamiliar, a mixed relay team consists of **four athletes (woman / man / woman / man)**, each completing a **mini triathlon** of about **600 m swim, 6 km bike, and 1.3 km run** before tagging the next teammate. It’s fast, intense, and over in less than two hours — pure energy from start to finish.

## Team & Pre-race

Four days before the race, I met my teammates at the Boathouse: **Lisa**, **Irina**, and **Gregory**. Together, we were **Team Canada III (X160)**.

The day before the race I joined the **swim familiarization**. The water looked calm and inviting — much easier than the individual event had been. While I was swimming, Lisa picked up our race packs (stickers for arms/calves/bike/helmet, timing chip, team cap, etc.).

#### Bike prep (the night before)
During the individual race my bike was *constantly squeaking and crackling*. I tried to isolate it — crankset, cassette, jockey wheels — but with the chain off the bottom bracket was quiet. I had recently switched to a **wax-based lube**; if it gets contaminated, it can get very noisy. The fix is a **deep clean + re-wax**. Time was short, so I raced with the noise.

*(Future me note: once back home, a proper deep clean plus **oil-based lube** made it silky smooth. I also replaced slightly bent wheel skewers — possibly part of the problem. Lesson learned: pre-trip bike prep matters.)*

## Race Morning

Another relaxed start: we met at **9:00 a.m.** at transition to sticker bikes, bags, and ourselves, and set up as usual. Then we moved to the relay holding area — a sequence of **gated zones**. First, only **leg-1** athletes entered; later they opened for **leg-2** (me), and so on. Inside, we received the **team timing chip** and waited. A big screen and a loudspeaker called teams, but they occasionally glitched, so we also scanned the chute ourselves.

I spotted **Lisa** charging in, we tagged — and I was off.

## My Leg

**Swim (600 m).** Slower than I expected despite calm water and low traffic. I went *no wetsuit*; usually that’s fine for me.

**T1 + Bike (6 km).** Transition smooth. The course was a shortened version of the individual loop: technical open, a slightly bigger early hill, then fast and flat. The soundtrack: my bike’s full creak orchestra.

**T2 + Run (1.3 km).** Clean T2. The run mirrored the individual route but **counterclockwise** and **without the big hill**, just a descent into the harbour where I tagged **Irina** for leg 3.

We cheered Irina in, then headed to **Lang Park** to await **Gregory**. The leg-4 athletes finished at the **main event park** — same finish as the individual race.

## Result & Vibes

We placed **21st of 40** teams — solid for an improvised squad with no podium expectations. The real goal was to **have fun**, and we absolutely did. We wrapped the day watching the **elites**, sharing a couple of drinks, and taking in the **closing ceremony** — a brilliant finish to an unforgettable week.
