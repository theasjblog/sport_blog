The Varsity was the competition between the two universities of Sheffield: Sheffield University (the one I attended), and Sheffield Hallam. The strong guys had their own "private" events, but there were a few more open to everyone.

I remember it was pretty cold, and there freezing rain earlier in the morning. I went to this event with my friend Denis, but we each did our own race. Which was good, because Denis got the number of laps wrong. It was a 4 laps race, but he thought it was only 3 laps, so he went out way too fast.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
race_date <- "2012-03-25"

source('../../../inst/aux_functions.R')

DT::datatable(get_summary_data(race_date),
              rownames = FALSE,
              filter = 'top',
              selection = 'single',
              escape = FALSE,
              options = list(
                paging =TRUE,
                pageLength =  10
              ))
```
