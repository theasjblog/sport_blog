This was my first competitive 10K. It was ran in and around the now demolished old athletic stadium in the outskirt of Sheffield (UK), the town I was living at the time. I do not remember much from this race, just the my housemate Olesya and trained together for a few months for this, and we went there by tram. I think we run it together, and I run at a pretty conservative pace.


## Summary

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
race_date <- "2010-04-18"

source('../../../inst/aux_functions.R')

DT::datatable(get_summary_data(race_date),
              rownames = FALSE,
              filter = 'top',
              selection = 'single',
              escape = FALSE,
              options = list(
                paging =TRUE,
                pageLength =  10
              ))
```
