Second time I ran this race. Nothing really changed from the first edition, and that was good, as it was a good race, well organized and fun to run.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
race_date <- "2012-07-16"

source('../../../inst/aux_functions.R')

DT::datatable(get_summary_data(race_date),
              rownames = FALSE,
              filter = 'top',
              selection = 'single',
              escape = FALSE,
              options = list(
                paging =TRUE,
                pageLength =  10
              ))
```
