This event was organized by the local branch of the Centro Sportivo Italiano (C.S.I.). It was a day of athletic competition for kids to honour the 50$^{th}$ anniversary of the local stadium.


I took part in the 400m, officially my first endurance events. I did pretty badly. I think I ended up last or next to last. I just was not used to "long" runs. I went all out for the first few meters, and then I just gave up. A very important lesson for the future.

Still, I got my participation medal.
