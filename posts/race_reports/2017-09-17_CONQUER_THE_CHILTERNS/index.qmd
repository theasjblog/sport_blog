A long swim in the Chiltern Hills, UK. This was a side event of a long course triathlon competition, and I decided to just test myself on a longer swim: 3K. 

It went as planned. And by as planned I mean that I was one of the last of the water. I think just 2 or 3 older ladies in their 60s or 70s were still swimming once I finished...Also, when I got out I got a massive cramp to a leg. Never felt a cramp so painful before, I struggled to move for a good 5 minutes. Definitely swimming is not my cup of tea.


```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
race_date <- "2017-09-17"

source('../../../inst/aux_functions.R')

DT::datatable(get_summary_data(race_date),
              rownames = FALSE,
              filter = 'top',
              selection = 'single',
              escape = FALSE,
              options = list(
                paging =TRUE,
                pageLength =  10
              ))
```
