This race was a precursor of times. Established well before things like Total Warriors, Spartan Race, or Tough Mudder became extremely popular and famous, it was an extremely well organized and fun race. A lot of fun and varied obstacles, this was the first edition of the race. The harder obstacle I remember was the one where we had to climb up an almost vertical drop with the aid of a rope. It must have been 50m, 80m top, but it was extremely slippery and challenging.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
race_date <- "2011-07-26"

source('../../../inst/aux_functions.R')

DT::datatable(get_summary_data(race_date),
              rownames = FALSE,
              filter = 'top',
              selection = 'single',
              escape = FALSE,
              options = list(
                paging =TRUE,
                pageLength =  10
              ))
```
