When one season ends, it's time to take a break---at least a couple of weeks. As the break winds down, I start planning for the next season. In this post, I'll walk you through my process.

### Step 1: Choose the Races

For me, the process always starts with selecting the races I want to tackle in the new season. My usual criteria are pretty subjective---proximity, races I've enjoyed before, or ones I've never tried. However, this year is a bit different.

Since I qualified for the Age Group World Championship, that race is non-negotiable. From there, I chose races that align with key points in the season where I can gauge my preparation. Another factor I considered was the race course itself. For example, I'm not used to open water swims in the ocean, so I opted for a race in a large body of water to simulate challenging swim conditions.

Here are the races I selected:

-   **Gravenhurst (June 8)**: The first race of the season. In Canada, races start late, so there aren\'t many options before this date.

-   **Bracebridge (July 13)**: A familiar course that provides excellent historical data to measure progress.

-   **Wasaga Beach (August 23)**: A swim in a large, often windy lake to test my skills in choppy water.

-   **Wollongong (October 17)**: The World Championship.

I may add one or two smaller races to fine-tune my readiness, but these are the main events.

### Step 2: Assign Race Priority

The next step is assigning a priority to each race, from A (high importance) to C (low importance). This step is crucial because your training schedule---including tapering---depends on these priorities. For example, A races require longer tapering phases, while C races may have little to no taper.

Here\'s how I prioritized my races:

-   **Gravenhurst**: C

-   **Bracebridge**: B

-   **Wasaga Beach**: C

-   **Wollongong**: A

### Step 3: Define Training Blocks

I\'m a big fan of Joe Friel's periodization system. According to this approach, your training progresses through distinct phases, such as *base*, *build*, *peak*, and *taper*. Each phase has a specific focus, balancing training volume and intensity while addressing your individual weaknesses.

If you\'re unfamiliar with this system, check out Joe Friel\'s [blog](https://joefrieltraining.com/blog/) or his book [The Triathlete\'s Training Bible](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/202197.The_Triathlete_s_Training_Bible). The [TrainingPeaks blog](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/) is another excellent resource.

In the past, I used a mix of DIY tools to plan my season and sessions. While this was effective, it was also incredibly time-consuming. To simplify things, I started using TrainingPeaks, occasionally purchasing pre-made plans. These plans worked well, and the platform's analytics were top-notch.

But life happens. Illness, work, or other commitments can disrupt even the best-laid plans. Adjusting a pre-made training plan isn't always easy, and many plans don't account for changes in your fitness over time. For these reasons, I switched to [HumanGo](https://humango.ai/) two seasons ago.

HumanGo is an AI-based virtual coach (named Hugo) that adapts your plan based on your performance and availability. Hugo can adjust your schedule if you need to skip sessions or if your fitness improves. While it's not perfect---AI can occasionally get things wrong---I've seen great results. After all, I qualified for the Age Group World Championship using this system.

If money were no object, I'd recommend hiring a real-life coach. But for those of us with budget constraints, HumanGo is a fantastic alternative.

### Step 4: Trust the Process

Once your plan is set, the key is to trust it. This can be challenging, especially with a new training system. However, it's crucial to follow the prescribed workouts---even the easy ones! Avoid the temptation to push harder than necessary, as this can lead to injury or burnout.

Monitor your progress, and if you're not improving after a few months, consider making changes. But start from a place of trust. And remember: consistency is the most important factor in improving. Stay consistent by having fun and staying injury-free (again, don't race your easy workouts!).

Good luck with your planning, and here's to a successful 2025 season!
