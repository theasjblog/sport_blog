"Giochi della gioventú" was (is?) an athletic high-school competition open to anyone. You could participate in many different events: 100m, 110m hurdles, 4X100m relay, high jump, long jump, put throw, etc. 

The first round was within the school. The winners in each event qualified for the next round and competed against kids from other schools. I remember I qualified one year, but I do not remember if it was this one.

At the time my main sport was basketball, and in this competition I was going for the 100m and the high jump, maybe once I did the 110m hurdles. I do not know exacly what I did in this event. Apparently my records says that I did the 100m in this event, and I finished 2$^{nd}$, but I cannot gurantee that's accurate. Also I am not 100% sure this happened in 1998.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(DT)
if(file.exists(file.path('data.json'))){
  tmp <- jsonlite::fromJSON(file.path('data.json'))
    breakdown <- tmp$breakdown
    tmp$breakdown <- NULL
    tmp <- as.data.frame(tmp) %>%
      dplyr::bind_cols(breakdown)

    details <- unlist(tmp$details)
    if(!is.null(details)){
      details <- paste0('<a href="',
                        details, '">Link to activity file</a>')
      details_names <- paste0('details_', seq(1, length(details)))
    } else {
      details_names <- NULL
    }

    tmp$details <- NULL


    df <- as.data.frame(t(tmp)) %>%
      dplyr::bind_rows(data.frame(V1 = details))

    df <- data.frame('  ' = c(colnames(tmp), details_names),
                     ' ' = df,
                     check.names = FALSE)
    colnames(df) <- NULL


    datatable(df,
              rownames = FALSE,
              selection = 'single',
              escape = FALSE,
              options = list(
                paging =TRUE,
                pageLength =  20
              ))
}
```
