This was the last qualifying event of the season. It was an early start. To be in Barrie at 6am, I left at 4am from Burlington.

It was a cold morning. So cold that the water temperature went was down to 16C from the 20C of the day before, and with the water that cold it was a westsuit mandatory race. A few people did not have wetsuit, and they got moved to the duathlon race. This probably messed up the results (more on this later).

Rob Eso, the guy I met in Welland (he finished third), was there too. So one of my main objective was to finish ahead of him.

I was not feeling 100%, but I started off reasonably well. I closed the swim in just over 14min. Nothing incredible, but pretty decent for me.

I got to transition and I could not see Rob's bike. I though he must have out swam me, which in fairness is a fairly easy thing to do.

T1 was not great, as with cold feet and cold hands it was a struggle to get the wetsuit off. Once again, I opted to put the shoes on, and not leave them on the bike, which worked out OK.

Off to the bike leg. 4 laps on very fast and very fast tarmac. I probably did not push out enough watts, but I still kept an average speed of about 37km/h. I was seeing Rob on some the straight, and I noticed I was catching up, but not fast enough. Damn! I though, he must have had a killer swim to be so much ahead.

Then we got to T2. Again I did not see Rob's bike there, which I found really strange. But off to run I went. As always, I did not feel fast at all, but it turned out to be a 22min run, which is in line with all the other runs of the season. During the straights, I saw Rob again, He was surprisingly behind, and he looked like he was not going particularly fast.

And finally, the finish line.

I checked the results: 5$^{th}$ in the Age Group. A bit disappointing, since a 5$^{th}$ place is not going to give a spot, but I need to remember that I cannot control who shows up the races, only what I do. And clearly in this race there were a lot of strong people.

But back to the mess of the timing for a second. Many official records, including mine, are incomplete, mostly missing the bike leg. For example, my record has a 14min swim, no bike, and a 53min run. Clearly, the run includes the bike leg as well.

The official records also say I finished 6$^{th}$, not 5$^{th}$. But when I look at the results of the guy who finished first, they are just not believable for a sprint triathlon from a 40-ish years old. First of all, the total time was 1h1min. Which would be a time that can compete with a 25 years old pro. Second, he also was missing the bike record, but his swim leg was 20min, and his run leg was 40min. Now, if you swim in 20min, you are unlikely fit enough to do a 20K bike and a 5K run in 40min. On top of that, 40min for a 20K bike and a 5K run would be an insanely fast split for an amateur 40-ish years old triathlete. Personally, I believe he did a duathlon instead. In that case, the first 20min would be for the 5K run, and the remaining 40min for the 20K bike and the 2.5K run, which is reasonable.

Finally, back to Rob. Turns out he swam in 15min, so I won there, then he cycled at 36km/h (again, point for me), but he messed up because he did 5 laps instead of 4. That took some wind out of his sail and finished the run in 23min. That sucks. I did that mistake in Birmingham years ago, and I know it is infuriating.
