My first solo 10K. Bradford is a town in Yorkshire, UK. I rode my motorbike there since there was a big car park near the race start, and it always easy to park a motorbike anyway. There was no real changing room, so it was a good thing that I was wearing my running gear under motorbike outfit. On the plus side, the baggage area was inside the town hall, a stereotypical old English large building fully carpeted, with a grand wooden and marble staircase, and old portraits of distinguished gentlemen everywhere.

The race itself was flat and fast, with a long stretch to the finish, even a bit downhill. I remember gathering all my renaming strength and sprinting to the finish line, a move that became an hallmark of my races later on and that I was using all the time to try to get past someone I was trying to chase down for the whole race.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(DT)
if(file.exists(file.path('data.json'))){
  tmp <- jsonlite::fromJSON(file.path('data.json'))
    breakdown <- tmp$breakdown
    tmp$breakdown <- NULL
    tmp <- as.data.frame(tmp) %>%
      dplyr::bind_cols(breakdown)

    details <- unlist(tmp$details)
    if(!is.null(details)){
      details <- paste0('<a href="',
                        details, '">Link to activity file</a>')
      details_names <- paste0('details_', seq(1, length(details)))
    } else {
      details_names <- NULL
    }

    tmp$details <- NULL


    df <- as.data.frame(t(tmp)) %>%
      dplyr::bind_rows(data.frame(V1 = details))

    df <- data.frame('  ' = c(colnames(tmp), details_names),
                     ' ' = df,
                     check.names = FALSE)
    colnames(df) <- NULL


    datatable(df,
              rownames = FALSE,
              selection = 'single',
              escape = FALSE,
              options = list(
                paging =TRUE,
                pageLength =  20
              ))
}
```
