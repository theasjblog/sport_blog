The Varsity was the competition between the two universities of Sheffield: Sheffield University (the one I attended), and Sheffield Hallam. The strong guys had their own "private" events, but there were a few more open to everyone.

I remember it was pretty cold, and there freezing rain earlier in the morning. I went to this event with my friend Denis, but we each did our own race. Which was good, because Denis got the number of laps wrong. It was a 4 laps race, but he thought it was only 3 laps, so he went out way too fast.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(DT)
if(file.exists(file.path('data.json'))){
  tmp <- jsonlite::fromJSON(file.path('data.json'))
    breakdown <- tmp$breakdown
    tmp$breakdown <- NULL
    tmp <- as.data.frame(tmp) %>%
      dplyr::bind_cols(breakdown)

    details <- unlist(tmp$details)
    if(!is.null(details)){
      details <- paste0('<a href="',
                        details, '">Link to activity file</a>')
      details_names <- paste0('details_', seq(1, length(details)))
    } else {
      details_names <- NULL
    }

    tmp$details <- NULL


    df <- as.data.frame(t(tmp)) %>%
      dplyr::bind_rows(data.frame(V1 = details))

    df <- data.frame('  ' = c(colnames(tmp), details_names),
                     ' ' = df,
                     check.names = FALSE)
    colnames(df) <- NULL


    datatable(df,
              rownames = FALSE,
              selection = 'single',
              escape = FALSE,
              options = list(
                paging =TRUE,
                pageLength =  20
              ))
}
```
