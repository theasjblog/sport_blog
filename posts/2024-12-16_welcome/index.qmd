**Welcome!** 

I'm a 40-year-old amateur triathlete with a passion for swimming, cycling, and running. By day, I navigate the corporate world in a 9-to-5 office job, but my heart truly comes alive when I'm training for my next race.

Let's start with some introduction.

### Planting the triathlon seed
My triathlon journey started in 2000 while watching the Summer Olympics—the first time triathlon was included in the schedule. I remember thinking how incredible those athletes were, swimming, then cycling, and then running. It seemed impossible, especially since I couldn't even swim.

Fast forward to 2012. I was living in Yorkshire, England, where the sport was impossible to ignore, especially with the Brownlee brothers dominating the international scene.

At that time, I had started participating in some casual running races. Nothing major, but it was a start.

Then fate stepped in—someone stole my motorbike. Instead of replacing it, I decided to buy a road bike.

### Race on!

That's when I decided to give triathlon a shot. I signed up for a local event with a short, pool-based swim and began training. I followed a pre-packaged Garmin plan while learning to swim from scratch.

I somehow made it to the starting line and, miraculously, to the finish line too. I made every rookie mistake possible: sprinting too hard in the swim and gasping for air after 50m, losing my bike in transition, getting lost on the run course, fumbling with my watch...

But none of that mattered. I fell in love with the sport and wanted more.

### Today

Fast forward to 2024—while much remains the same, everything has also changed. I still love the sport, but I'm now more experienced in my training, albeit older and slower. Between my 9-to-5 job, wife, and two kids, triathlon isn't my only commitment. I have other hobbies that demand attention too. Balancing everything is a delicate art.

Follow this blog to join me on my racing journey and see how I manage this balancing act.
