This was another one of my home races, in Sheffield, UK. The starting line was in city center, near the Crucible.The race was the biggest one I have ever done to this time, with thousands of people taking part. It was an almost flat route, except for a downhill start, and an uphill finish.

The added bit of fun was that participants could choose to participate for the White Rose or the Red Rose, a reminiscence of the War of the Roses.

Because the race was run reasonably close to city center, it was full of people cheering and bands, which was very motivational.
