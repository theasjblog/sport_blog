This is probably the last one of the virtual challenges I'll do for a while. I normally use these things to get motivated to do something after a long break, i.e., after COVID. This was part of bundle offer I got after I relocated from UK to Canada and I had to stop swimming and cycling properly for a few months. I decided to use only swim activities for this challenge.

Now I have finished all the challenges that were part of the bundle, and the Age Group World Championship is motivation enough to get me pushing.
