## The real price of a dream

Competing at the **World Triathlon Championships** is one of the highest honours for any age-group athlete.  
But unlike professional or Olympic racers, **there‚Äôs no financial support from the federation** ‚Äî every athlete covers their own costs.  

It‚Äôs a reality that surprises many people. You qualify to wear the maple leaf, but then you pay for the privilege: registration, uniforms, travel, accommodation, and more.  
Below, I‚Äôve broken down the main expenses into three categories.

---

## 1. Compulsory expenses

These are **non-negotiable** ‚Äî every athlete must cover them to be eligible to race for Team Canada.  
They include the official race entry, national uniforms, and mandatory insurance.

| Item | Category | Amount (CAD) |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| Race registration (Sprint) | Compulsory |  |
| Team Canada race kit (tri suit, jacket) | Compulsory |  |
| Parade kit (polo, shorts, hat) | Compulsory |  |
| Insurance & federation admin fees | Compulsory |  |
| **Subtotal** |  | **X CAD** |

> üí° *If you already own a recent Team Canada kit, you may be allowed to reuse it, saving a few hundred dollars.*

---

## 2. Situation-dependent expenses

These depend on where you live, how you travel, and your lodging preferences.  
Getting yourself (and your bike) to Wollongong from Canada is no small financial feat ‚Äî this is usually where the biggest costs come in.

| Item | Category | Amount (CAD) |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| Flight (round-trip) | Situation-dependent |  |
| Bike transport or shipping | Situation-dependent |  |
| Accommodation (number of nights) | Situation-dependent |  |
| Ground transportation & transfers | Situation-dependent |  |
| Meals & groceries | Situation-dependent |  |
| **Subtotal** |  | **Y CAD** |

> üè° *Sharing an Airbnb or rental house with teammates can drastically cut lodging costs ‚Äî sometimes by half.*

---

## 3. Optional extras

Some expenses aren‚Äôt strictly necessary but are part of the experience ‚Äî souvenirs, event expo items, or extra federation gear that you‚Äôll probably end up buying anyway.

| Item | Category | Amount (CAD) |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| Extra federation apparel (hoodie, t-shirt, etc.) | Optional |  |
| Purchases from event expo | Optional |  |
| Souvenirs or gifts | Optional |  |
| **Subtotal** |  | **Z CAD** |

---

## Total cost

When all is said and done:

| Type | Total (CAD) |
|------|--------------|
| Compulsory | X |
| Situation-dependent | Y |
| Optional | Z |
| **Grand Total** | **X + Y + Z CAD** |

That‚Äôs the full picture ‚Äî what it really costs to race the World Championships as an age-group athlete representing Canada.  
It‚Äôs not cheap, but for most of us, it‚Äôs worth every cent for the experience of standing on the start line with the maple leaf on our chest.

---

## A few caveats and notes

* I did **not** include expenses like new running shoes, tires, or prep races ‚Äî those are part of normal training and would have been incurred anyway.  
* Some costs can be reduced if you reuse your race kit from previous years or borrow items like bike travel cases.  
* Booking flights and accommodations early can make a huge difference, especially for long-haul destinations like Australia.

## Final thoughts

The experience of racing at Worlds comes with a significant price tag, but also with an immeasurable reward ‚Äî representing your country, sharing the course with athletes from around the world, and closing a long chapter of hard work and dedication.

It‚Äôs not just an investment in a single race ‚Äî it‚Äôs an investment in a lifelong memory.
