# Wollongong Worlds: My Overall Experience

> *“Competing at Worlds wasn’t just a race — it was a celebration of everything that led there.”*

Going to the World Championships is one of those moments you can only dream about when you first start in the sport — a distant goal that somehow feels impossible. When the email confirming my qualification arrived, it hit me: this was it. Years of training, early mornings, and determination had led to this.  

Representing Canada made it even more meaningful. Wearing the maple leaf among the best age-group athletes from around the world filled me with pride — and a sense of belonging to something bigger than myself.

## The days before — excitement and nerves

In the weeks before the trip, excitement mixed with anxiety. Beyond racing, I worried about logistics: would my bike survive the journey? Would my luggage make it? I checked my packing list more times than I’d like to admit.

The trip itself was a marathon — over 30 hours of travel and plenty of airport waiting. I refreshed my AirTag app every few minutes to make sure the bike was on the right terminal, waiting to be loaded on the plane. When I finally landed in Sydney around 9 a.m., I learned my room wouldn’t be ready until 3 p.m.

So, instead of resting, I dropped my bags and walked straight to the race venue to register and explore the expo. It was hot, I was tired, and all I wanted was a shower — but somehow I ended up walking more than 20,000 steps that day. The adrenaline of finally being there carried me through.

## Settling in — team moments and first impressions

Day 2 started with a short shake-out run and a quick stop to tune up the bike. Then came the Team Canada lunch at the Boathouse — a perfect spot by the water. It was great to finally meet the people I’d only known through emails and group chats, including my mixed relay teammates.

Later that afternoon, we had swim familiarization, followed by the Parade of Nations in the evening. Another 20,000-step day. All athletes gathered at Flagstaff Hill, standing behind their national flags before walking down to Lang Park.  

The ceremony opened with a Land Acknowledgement and a Smoke Ceremony, followed by a live performance of the Australian national anthem.

## The calm before the race

By Day 3, my body started to protest. My calves felt tight from all the walking, so I spent most of the day in the hotel with my legs up and compression socks on. Later, I checked in my bike — the ritual that makes everything suddenly feel real.

Day 4 was individual race day. My start time was later in the morning, which gave me a chance to enjoy the buzz around transition and soak in the atmosphere. I’ll save the race details for the next post, but racing on that course — with that crowd and that competition — was every bit as special as I’d imagined.

## The second half of the week

The day after the race was all about recovery. I went to the team relay swim familiarization and watched the elites racing the T100 event — yet another victory for Hayden Wilde and a strong show by Kate Waugh.

Day 6 was relay day: fast, intense, and a lot of fun. I’ll share the race details in its own post. For some reason, I thought that we were not allowed to pick up the bikes until 2pm, so after the race I went back to the hotel to shower and eat. When I got back to the venue to watch the elites racing the Standard distance, I realized the transition area was already open. I could have picked up the bike earlier and save a trip back to the hotel...

That evening, I joined some Team Canada athletes for drinks, watched the medal and closing ceremonies, and listened to speeches from the local mayor and triathlon officials. The event ended with the passing of the flag from Wollongong to Pontevedra.

## Heading home

Day 7 was the long journey back. More airports, more waiting, and more obsessive AirTag tracking to make sure my bike was following along. By the time I finally got home, the week felt like a blur — a mix of exhaustion, pride, and gratitude.


![OK, the bike is still with me.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-10-15_WOLLONGONG/img/IMG_2304.png)

Competing at Worlds wasn’t just about a single race. It was a celebration of everything that led there — the training, the people, the resilience. Wollongong will always be the week where all those years of effort came together in one unforgettable moment. Hopefully there will be more Worlds to come, but you can never forget the first one!
