### Notes
- `cols=` controls the number of columns on larger screens; it will auto-stack on mobile.  
- The `lightbox: auto` line in the YAML activates the pop-up viewer when you click an image.  
- You can also add captions inline like this:
  ```markdown
  ![Finish line moment]{fig-alt="Finish line moment" fig-cap="Finish line moment"}
