# Introduction

Every triathlon season tells a story — not just of watts, splits, and meters swum, but of consistency, learning, and the daily choices that shape the big picture. 

Between October 2024 and October 2025, I logged roughly **380 hours of structured training** across swim, bike, run, and strength work. The load was significantly higher than last year and comparable to 2023.

In this post, I’ll cover both the **metrics and the meaning** behind them: monthly training trends, load distribution, and how key markers like FTP, pace, and heart rate changed through the season. But more importantly, I’ll share what those numbers meant — the highs that built confidence, the lows that tested patience, and how it all came together -or not- on race day.

# Season Overview

In 2025, I logged **380 hours** of training.

The number of sessions was fairly balanced across disciplines. The time distribution also makes sense when you think of a sprint triathlon: swimming is the shortest leg, cycling takes the longest, and running sits somewhere in between.

What was likely too low, though, was time in the gym. The “strength” category also includes mobility and foam-rolling, so the actual time lifting weights was even smaller. I need to work more on overall strength — core stability, shoulder power for swimming, and leg endurance for both bike and run.

## Monthly Distribution

I like to look at monthly training time to assess consistency. Ideally, volume remains fairly stable, with a gentle decline during race season as intensity ramps up.

I built volume steadily from October 2024 through January 2025, followed by a dip in February (I caught a cold then). The biggest drop came between April and July — partly due to racing, partly to a motivation dip, and critically, to growing doubts about the **Humango** coaching platform I was using at the time. Things normalized again after July.

## Performance Chart

Training volume is only part of the story. To track fitness, I rely on the **TRIMP curve** in Golden Cheetah — a metric similar to TrainingPeaks’ TSS, combining intensity and duration.

As expected from the mid-season dip, TRIMP dropped in those months. On the bright side, fitness peaked right before my A race at Worlds, with fatigue well under control (around -4 the day before the individual race). Though race-week logistics certainly added some hidden fatigue, the numbers suggest I timed the peak well.

# Swim

Swimming remains my Achilles’ heel. I trained consistently and even hit sub-1:40/100m pace in the pool — but in open water, that speed just vanishes. It’s frustrating.

I spent a decent amount of time in the water and swam outdoors whenever possible, often at **Cherry Beach** in Toronto. Yet, my pace dropped from an already modest **8:00/500m in the pool** to about **9:16/500m in open water**.

![Swim: 2025 season overview.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-11-06_SEASON_RECAP/swim_overview.png)

Looking at peak swim pace over 10- and 20-minute efforts (roughly the window for a 750m race) tells the same story.

![Swim peak pace. Frustratingly flat.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-11-06_SEASON_RECAP/swim_pace.png)

The trend is almost flat. There’s a slight improvement toward the end of the season, but that’s likely due to race-specific sharpening. I clearly need structured coaching — either joining a club or booking one-on-one sessions.

# Bike

Cycling usually brings me more satisfaction. I often race on a **road bike** against athletes on TT bikes, but at least my legs hold their own.

![Bike: 2025 season overview.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-11-06_SEASON_RECAP/bike_overview.png)

First, the **VO$_{2}$ max trend**. There’s a gradual increase overall, with dips in June and September. I’m not entirely sure why — though I suspect inconsistent body-weight updates in Golden Cheetah might distort the estimate.

Next, the **peak 20- and 30-minute power**, which approximate race effort duration.

![Bike: peak 20min and 30min power trend.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-11-06_SEASON_RECAP/bike_peak_w.png)

This metric stayed fairly flat, even trending slightly downward late in the season. That September dip aligns with the VO$_{2}$ drop — something to monitor. It might represent a true plateau or a need to adjust my training stimulus.

Finally, I tracked **Power/Heart Rate**, a solid proxy for aerobic efficiency — more watts per heartbeat means better fitness.

![Bike: power over heart rate trend.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-11-06_SEASON_RECAP/bike_whr.png)

This ratio trended nicely upward, despite small dips in March–April and September. That suggests my aerobic base continued improving even when top-end numbers stalled.

# Run

Running was the biggest struggle this year — especially in races. In one event, I was on the edge of a fever; in another, heat wiped me out. But more generally, I couldn’t produce speed off the bike.

This was one of the reasons I left Humango. The platform rarely prescribed **brick runs** or intensity during the build phase — exactly when I needed them. After switching to ChatGPT-based coaching, I did a standalone 5K test and ran my **fastest time in five years**. The potential is there; I just need to translate it off the bike.

![Run: 2025 season overview.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-11-06_SEASON_RECAP/run_overview.png)

The **VO$_{2}$ max trend** looks encouraging — a clear upward slope.

![Run: VO$_{2}$ max trend.](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport_small/2025-11-06_SEASON_RECAP/run_vo2.png)

The **run power trend** also improved steadily, though the jump in June reflects a switch from Stryd to the built-in Garmin Forerunner 965 sensor.

Lastly, **peak pace** shows a nice downward trend — faster speeds over time.

Not a massive improvement, but consistent progress.

# Highs and Lows

This season was full of contrasts. It ended on a high note with the **World Championships**, and I also claimed age-group wins in both the **Indoor Triathlon Championship** and the **Canada Multisport Series**. Those results look great on paper — though, to be fair, participation matters as much as speed in these series. In both cases, I was the only athlete in my age group completing three qualifying races.

My race results included **2nd, 3rd, and 5th** place finishes. Respectable, but slower than my targets — especially in swim and run splits. Still, representing **Team Canada** and running my fastest 5K in years were undeniable highlights.

# Lessons Learned

Here’s what I’m taking forward:

* Monitor trends (power, pace, HR ratio) continuously, and adjust training sooner.  
* **Lose weight** — I’m carrying ~8 kg more than ideal, which can cost ~3.5 minutes on a rolling sprint course.  
* Find a **swimming club** or book 1-on-1 coaching.  
* Stay on top of **bike maintenance**.  
* Do more **strength** and **mobility**.  
* Schedule regular **massage** and recovery work.

Now that I’ve refined how I use ChatGPT as a virtual coach, I can provide better inputs and context — making feedback loops tighter and adjustments smarter.

# 2026 Goals

Next year will be another ambitious one. I plan to add **duathlon** to my calendar — partly to see how removing the swim affects performance. My aim is to qualify for the **2027 World Championships** in both sprint triathlon and sprint duathlon.

Performance goals that depend only on me:

* Run a **sub-20-minute 5K**.  
* Improve swimming technique and efficiency.  
* Reach **77 kg race weight**.  
* Race the bike leg at **≥ 3.5 W/kg** (currently ~3.0 W/kg).

It’s going to be a challenging season — and I’m excited for it.
