Making it to the World Championships is something I had dreamed of for a long time. But if there’s one thing I learned along the way, it’s that there isn’t a single formula for getting there. This post is not a guide or a checklist—it’s simply my own perspective on what it took for **me** to reach the start line in Wollongong.

### Everyone’s path is different

This is a highly subjective topic. Different athletes are gifted in different ways: some can achieve great performances with minimal training, while others—like me—need to grind every week.  
I don’t consider myself naturally predisposed for endurance sports. I have a heavier build and grew up doing power-based activities like basketball, not swimming, biking, or running. So for me, it was less about raw talent and more about **persistence**.

### Consistency over intensity

My season started in mid-October 2024. Since then, I’ve trained almost continuously, with only two or three weeks completely off due to sickness or minor injuries.  
It’s not the single hard workouts that make the difference—it’s showing up, week after week. Even when tired, even when the weather’s bad, even when motivation drops.  

Below, I’ll include a summary table (or screenshot) showing the hours I spent in each discipline across the season.

> 💡 Consistency beats intensity. The magic happens when you stack hundreds of “pretty good” days together.

### Have a plan—and be critical of it

You need a plan. But more importantly, you need to **reflect on it**.  
Trust the process and be patient—but also **measure your progress** and make adjustments when something isn’t working. Blindly following a plan for months without seeing improvement is a recipe for frustration.

I started using **HumanGo** at first, which was great. But when they upgraded to version 2.0, I started to lose confidence in its approach, so I switched to ChatGPT for guidance (I’ll write a separate post on how I use it). That change forced me to be more engaged with my own training decisions, and that made a big difference.

### Balancing life, work, and training

I have a 9-to-5 job and two young children. That means a lot of **4:30 AM alarms**, or late evenings after the kids go to bed. Sometimes both in the same day.  
It’s a constant balancing act—between training volume, intensity, recovery, work performance, and family time.

The key is not to overreach. Fatigue management matters as much as training itself. The goal is to keep improving **without burning out or getting injured**, because missing months of training breaks consistency—and consistency is everything.

And of course, none of this would be possible without a **supportive partner**. Having someone who understands why you go to bed at 8:30 PM or why the living room smells like chlorine is absolutely essential.

### Everything counts

Unless you’re naturally gifted, every little detail matters.  
How you train. At what intensity. How you eat. How you sleep. How you recover. It all adds up.

That said, there’s a fine line between being disciplined and being obsessed.  
Sometimes you’ll have a late night, skip a meal prep, or grab fast food between meetings—and that’s perfectly fine. The key is not to let those moments derail your mindset. Stay focused on the long-term trajectory, not perfection.

### In the end

Making it to the Worlds wasn’t about a single race or lucky break—it was about a year of structured, consistent, and sometimes imperfect effort.  
A lot of early mornings, a lot of tired evenings, but also a lot of satisfaction from watching gradual progress turn into something real.
