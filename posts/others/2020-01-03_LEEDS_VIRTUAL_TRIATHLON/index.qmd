This was a "real life" race I entered, but COVID-19 had other plans. The race was cancelled, but participants were given the option to "compete" virtually by completing the bike and run distance over the week end. I guess it was two events over two days to comply with the UK government rule that onl allowed us to go out of the house to exercise once a day.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
race_date <- "2020-01-03"

source('../../../inst/aux_functions.R')

DT::datatable(get_summary_data(arrow::read_parquet('https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs_josa/sport/parquets/main_dataset.parquet') |>
  filter(as.character(event_date) == race_date)),
              rownames = FALSE,
              filter = 'top',
              selection = 'single',
              escape = FALSE,
              options = list(
                paging =TRUE,
                pageLength =  10
              ))
```
