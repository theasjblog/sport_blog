This was a "real life" race I entered, but COVID-19 had other plans. The race was cancelled, but participants were given the option to "compete" virtually by completing the bike and run distance over the week end. I guess it was two events over two days to comply with the UK government rule that onl allowed us to go out of the house to exercise once a day.
