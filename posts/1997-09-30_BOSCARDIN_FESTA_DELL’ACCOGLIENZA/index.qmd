This was an assortment of random events organized for every fresh(wo)man of my high-school. I do not recall much, only that I won. If I won overall, or some category only (or if there were categories in the first place), I do not know. I was probably too busy looking at a red head that got my attention, hoping she ended up in my class. Spoiler alert, she did, and we also dated for a while, and that was a much better achievement.

## Summary
