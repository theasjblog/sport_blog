![MultiSport Canada Champions plaque.](img/cover.png)

At the end of November last year I received an e-mail from MultiSport Canada saying that I finished first in their race seriaes for the Sprint Triathlon, in my age group!

I did not even know they were running a race! I thought it was just a number of isoalted events organized by the same company. They asked me if I wanted to recive an e-certificate, or a physical plaque. I do have a thing for physical media, so I asked for a plaque.

Fast forward nearly 2 months, and here it is, fresh from the mail. For a while I was afraid it got lost ion all that mess that was the month long Canada Post strike, but no, it eventually made it to my home.

Meanwhile, I had the time to look at how the series work:

-   You need to complete at least three events organized by MultiSport Canada
-   If you compete in more than three events, only the best three placements will count
-   Points are awarded as follow:

|             |            |
|-------------|:----------:|
| **Placing** | **Points** |
| 1           |    100     |
| 2           |     90     |
| 3           |     85     |
| 4           |     80     |
| 5           |     75     |
| 6           |     70     |
| 7           |     65     |
| 8           |     60     |
| 9           |     55     |
| 10          |     50     |

-   There are a lot of rules to break ties

Here is a screenshot of the top three M40-44 from [SportStats](https://sportstats.one/series/multisport-canada/points/6047):
