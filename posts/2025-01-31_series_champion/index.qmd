What an incredible surprise to cap off an amazing year of racing! When that email from MultiSport Canada landed in my inbox announcing my first-place finish in the Sprint Triathlon series, I was genuinely shocked. I hadn't even realized I was competing in a series – talk about a pleasant surprise!

Looking at those point totals now – 90 ([Welland](/posts/2024-06-23_WELLAND_ROSE_CITY_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/index.qmd)), 90 ([Bracebridge](/posts/2024-07-07_BRACEBRIDGE_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/index.qmd)), and 75 ([Barrie](/posts/2024-08-11_BARRIE_SPRINT_TRIATHLON/index.qmd)) – each number represents a story, a race where I pushed my limits and competed against not just others, but myself. That second-place finishe in Welland is particularly special: that was the race that gave the slot for the Age Group World Championship.

But beyond the points and placements, what really makes this achievement special is what it represents: consistency, dedication, and the pure joy of competing. To think that my performance across these three races was strong enough to clinch the series title – it's honestly still sinking in!

And now, as I hold this plaque in my hands (after its adventure through the Canada Post strike!), I can't help but feel even more motivated for what's ahead. This isn't just a recognition of past achievements; it's fuel for future goals, especially as I prepare for the Age Group World Championship.
