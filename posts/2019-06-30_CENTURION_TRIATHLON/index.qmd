This was the first attempt at a long-ish distance, with the added difficulties of not being really trained for it.

The swim was OK. Nothing special, but I managed. The main issue I had was that I could not really see. My googles were leaking pretty badly. As a result, I crushed against another competitor, which a few days later I discovered be Simon, a fellow TriForce club member.

The bike was pretty hilly, but nice.

The problems started on the run. From very early on, it was clear I had nothing left. I ended up having to walk part of it, with just the occasional jog so that the TriForce photographer could take some action-looking pictures. Good thing I picked the metric and not the imperial Centurion.

At the end I stayed on the venue for a bit under the TriForce tent.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(DT)
if(file.exists(file.path('data.json'))){
  tmp <- jsonlite::fromJSON(file.path('data.json'))
    breakdown <- tmp$breakdown
    tmp$breakdown <- NULL
    tmp <- as.data.frame(tmp) %>%
      dplyr::bind_cols(breakdown)

    details <- unlist(tmp$details)
    if(!is.null(details)){
      details <- paste0('<a href="',
                        details, '">Link to activity file</a>')
      details_names <- paste0('details_', seq(1, length(details)))
    } else {
      details_names <- NULL
    }

    tmp$details <- NULL


    df <- as.data.frame(t(tmp)) %>%
      dplyr::bind_rows(data.frame(V1 = details))

    df <- data.frame('  ' = c(colnames(tmp), details_names),
                     ' ' = df,
                     check.names = FALSE)
    colnames(df) <- NULL


    datatable(df,
              rownames = FALSE,
              selection = 'single',
              escape = FALSE,
              options = list(
                paging =TRUE,
                pageLength =  20
              ))
}
```
