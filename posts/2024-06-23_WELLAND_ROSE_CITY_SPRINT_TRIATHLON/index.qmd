Another qualifying event. On paper, the route profile for the bike and the run were much easier than Guelph. An almost flat course.

The swim was in a canal used for boat racing. I only learnt about this after the race, but something to keep in mind for the next time: the long sides were following the race buoy guides. So, to swim the shortest route possible, just follow the submerged guides. Like swimming in a pool.

As I said, I did not know that. I managed to swim fairly straight with a GPS swim distance of 780m, so 30m more than the official distance. At a 2min/100m pace, this would have cost me roughly 25s. We will come back to this later.

It was an odd swim. It was swimsuit optional, but for those trying to qualify swimsuits were not allowed. As a result, there was a mixed field of people with and without wetsuit, make it a bit unfair. Also, for those qualifying, the "non westuit" policy will be enforced on a honorary base...

Anyway, I my swim felt OK. I was controlling my breathing better than in Guelph, and it felt like the water was moving fast next to me. Except, when I got of the water and looked at my watch, I saw a swim time of 17min. WTF! How did that happen?!?

But it was no time to think about it. A short run to T1, and off for the bike leg. And here I had a small problem with the pedals. I did attach my shoes with elastics, but the elastics came off too soon, and the shoes did not want to stay up straight. To put them on I had to stop, take them off the pedal, put them on, and start cycling again. It felt like an eternity.

Then the reality of the bike course hit. It was flat, yes, but very windy. Every second half of each of the 5 laps felt like going uphill. I was catching up a lot of people, but when I was looking at the fast looking guys as a reference it did not look like I was gaining anything on them. Truth be told, most of them were probably under 30, but still...

Finally, on the run. The route was flat, but made slow but a few sharp corners. And as always, my legs refused to collaborate. In fairness, probably I did push a bit too much on the bike. In places, my watch was telling I was going as slow as 5:05min/Km.

Total race time: 1h18m. My slowest sprint triathlon ever.

After some time, I decided to look at the results online. 2nd on the age group! I guess it was a tough race for everyone. And also a reminder to not compare triathlon races with each other: each race is completely different.

So that was good. The annoying bit was that I finished 22s behind the first. So close to having a chance to qualify. Makes me wonder what if I swam closer to the 750m? Or what if I did a better T1? Or I pushed just a bit more on the run? Too late know, cannot win races with "what ifs.

The last annoying bit of the day was the very long delay for the award: almost 3h between the end of the race and the awards ceremony. An eternity.

But I made a friend: the guy who finished 3rd: Robert Eso. We'll meet again later this year in Berrie.
